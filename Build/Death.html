            <h2>Death</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15">&nbsp;&nbsp; The universal rule of death, Hekahuh's Mystery, is that no one knows exactly what happens after you die. For all the power that mortals can hold over life and death, they are not closer to understanding exactly what death is than they were a thousand years ago. For reference, when raised from the dead (whether back to life or undeath) they have no memory of what happened between their death and that moment. Speak with Dead only talks to the corpse, and other powerful magic can in no way directly contact a person after their death- though the memories or convictions of a person can create echoes after death.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; This has lead to practically every culture having their own views and beliefs of what happens after death. Most cultures believe in the distinct individual continuing to exist as a "soul" after death in some form or another, though not all share this belief. Many of these beliefs are responsible for the historic fear and hatred of undead- creatures that violate the order of things. Many academics debate the existence of the soul- some claim that a life is just a confluence of various planar energies that exist at a point in time, others claim that mortals are simply parts of the prime material- no more valuable than a rock or tree. Either way, no matter how long the debate goes on, it appears that there can never be any concrete proof of what happens after death.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is possible to directly speak with the gods, many have attempted to ask them for a definitive answer. &nbsp;This does not actually result in any kind of useful clarification. &nbsp;Different deities answer the question in wildly different ways. &nbsp;Hekahuh, the actual god of the Dead, gives no answer at all. &nbsp;Bellaphex never gives the same one twice, and all are lies.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Various societies and religions also have their various traditional beliefs about death and dying. Here are some examples-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Lycans</span><span class="rvts13">- The Lycans believe that the dead rise to the sky and join Luna in the stars to watch over their descendants throughout the world. They prefer to burn their dead under an open sky, preferably at night- freeing the soul and body to return to Luna. Some scholars claim this is because ancient Lycans needed to prevent necromancers from getting their hands on potentially valuable or dangerous Lycan corpses, or to further prevent the spread of affliction. For their part, Lycans do not have a great taboo against raising dead, whether undead or otherwise- they are used to changing forms, and see it as simply an individual in a different form. They generally dislike nonsentient undead, and some particularly devout Lycans see it as a disgrace very similar to an afflicted lycanthrope.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Serpente-</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;The serpente are surprisingly noncommital on death- they freely admit that they have no idea what happens after death. They also seem to think it doesn't really matter too much. When a person dies, they mourn, but they also celebrate. They mourn the passing of a person that they may never see again, but they also celebrate the fact that they lived in the first place. They claim that this belief comes from Drakaulos- that his gift of Nothing was more of a challenge, to accomplish all that you could within your lifespan. Some serpente take bits and pieces from other religions into their own personal beliefs. They have no taboo against raising or undeath.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Sea Halflings</span><span class="rvts13">- Sea Halflings of the Dagnostic Hierarchy view life as a pleasant midpoint caught between periods of suffering, providing meaning and change to an otherwise bleak and pointless reality--and that said reality does its best to squash, excise, or remove said midpoint as a side effect of its inherent resistance to change. Death is considered inevitable, and a quiet, swift, or painless death is a great blessing to be honored, rather than shamed or mourned. The only afterlife (and beforelife) mentioned by the Hierarchy is the Hunger, a period of eons before and after existence where the soul lingers as a part of the chaotic "will" that "governs" their sea environment. The Hunger is said to be excruciatingly painful, as the souls in question experience the demands, urges, pains, and feelings of every being from life to death, as well as the turbulent, voracious violence of the sea itself; particularly painful souls return as Hungry Ghosts, vicious spirits that haunt their death sites, screaming in agony and uncontrolled rage. &nbsp;The only salvation comes from "She Who Dwells Below;" according to the Hierarchy, She has promised to devour utterly the souls of all true followers of Her, allowing them to escape a tortured afterlife (and potential Reincarnation) for both peaceful oblivion and the promise of being part of something greater than themselves.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Members of the Dagnostic Hierarchy typically refuse all attempts at&nbsp;resurrection.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Primarchy</span><span class="rvts13">- Beliefs about the afterlife of Primarch worship vary fairly significantly between worshippers; the Priesthood has yet to make a statement as to the exact nature of the afterlife, and generally views focusing on it to be "missing the point of existence." The vast majority of the followers of the Primarch-as-a-god believe that they ascend to a divine hall where all good Forged dwell upon death, awaiting either an inevitable "reforging" into a new being, or an afterlife of building an eternal paradise with their god. Non-forged worshippers of the Primarch tend to lean more towards the Eternal Paradise, though subcults of so-called "Future Forged" do exist.</span></p>
