            <h2>Orcs</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">The Short&nbsp;Version</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #c7c7c7;  background-color : #c7c7c7; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Powerful, emotionally distant creatures who immerse themselves fully in the Martial Arts. The Haff'Orcs, or just Orcs, of the world are known for their strict adherence to a warrior code, their perpetual bondage to Hobgoblin masters, and their fearless ferocity on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">If you are an orc, most folks will expect you to be violent and dangerous, but only to those who your master detests.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be prideful and honor-obsessed, but stoic and disciplined in the face of danger.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">They will expect that you will be the first to the fray in any conflict, but will approach every conflict with the same lethal intensity and lack of self-preservation, regardless of how serious the conflict actually is.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Other than Dragonborn, Haff'Orcs are the most massive of the common races, rarely standing under 6' and often weighing around 200 lbs, although they can easily be larger with proper diet and training. Broad shouldered and barrel chested, the thick skin of an Orc can make it somewhat difficult to appreciate how dense their musculature is, as their somewhat leathery hide prevents much in the way of detail or definition. Nearly all Haff'Orcs are swarthy, and have skin tones that range from a deep ebony to a jungle green. Their hair color is often reddish, although most Orcs prefer to keep their scalp hair either totally shorn or barely more than stubble.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">One common way of distinguishing Orcs, however, is by their body markings; while the specifics vary significantly from tribe to tribe, few Haff'Orcs go their entire lives without some form of body modification to indicate their status, profession, or any other particular individuality. Typically either scars, brands, tattoos or piercings, these markings are rarely subtle or difficult to miss, unless covered. That said, anyone who is not intimately acquainted with the intricacies of these markings would be well advised to not try to read anything from them; for example, while one tribe of Haff'Orcs may ritually scar their warriors in order to indicate their rite of passage into a military order, there are others who consider such 'artificial scars' to be pure braggadocio, with only authentic battle scars having any merit, and then there are others which scar deserters in order to mark their failures, and then there are </span><span class="rvts45">still</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;others that consider scars of any sort to be a sign of clumsiness and incompetence. And lets not even get started on the tattoos. In general, it's best to avoid trying to make any assumptions about an Orc by these markings, and instead simply note them to allow you to, well, better distinguish them from others, as even Haff'Orc's hobgoblin masters will admit that they all tend to have similar facial and body structures.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts57"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts57">(Any wishing to better acquaint themselves with the intricacies of these markings are encouraged to read&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts71">Scar Wars: A Historie of Orcish Tribal Conflict</span><span class="rvts57">&nbsp;by Mualim Hassalid, noted hobgoblin scholar.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts57"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps23"><a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/c02ebfbc5a574beab32f1f2a6a56bf07/tumblr_meuer2kn8m1r1y4kjo1_500.jpg"><img alt="Orcs" src="lib/NewItem11.png"></a></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts42"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts42">Haff'Orc society can be difficult for most outsiders to comprehend; its concepts of Honor, Vow, and Word are often deeply cryptic, and apparently purposefully so. The most important takeaway for anyone who is not, themselves, an Orc is to recognize that their beliefs in their position and responsibilities in their particular societies are as deeply important to them as the most serious religious vows or legal contracts, and have their origins in the Orcish self identity and their perception of their, for lack of a better term, Humanity and Soul. Indeed, the name Haff'Orc roughly translates to "Souled Orc". Unfortunately, when first being transcribed to Common, this name was incorrectly transliterated as "Half-Orc", which gave rise to all sorts of misconceptions about the origins of their kind. Suffice to say, Orcs are not Half-Breeds of any kind, and as far as has been determined have no natural hybrids with any race, and the less said about those misconceptions, the better.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts42"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">One of the easiest, and most fundamental, concepts of Orc society is to clarify what they </span><span class="rvts45">aren't</span><span class="rvts44">. Orcs are not Orks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Again, this is where the language barrier really confuses things. It's a lot clearer in Goblinoid, where the specific intonation makes it more distinct. The best approximation is to try to pronounce the O in Ork like you would the O in Omega, or Over.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts42">Although resembling the general morphology of Orks, the brutish, violent, only-borderline-tribal humanoids that inhabit much of the Eastern and Southeastern jungles of the Mainland Continent and which make regular impetuous forays into the Central Plains to pillage and murder, Orc culture makes a </span><span class="rvts73">very big deal</span><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;of distinguishing themselves from those "abominations". This cannot be stressed enough. If you are not an Orc, it is advised that you don't even broach the subject while interacting with one, but for proper context, a great deal of their concepts of morality and ethical behavior is based around avoiding acting like these creatures. The Orcish equivalent of the concept of Unforgivable Damnation, acts so heinous that there is no possible repentance, is "to act in a way that you could be </span><span class="rvts73">mistaken</span><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;for an ork". There are theories (that are best not brought up while with Orcs) that the root of this clear separation has to do with the original orcs being a less-unreasonably-aggressive, more social mutation of Orks which early Hobgoblins were able to, ehem, adapt into a capable servant-race of soldiers. This can be seen reflected in some psychological similarities as well; Like Orks, Orcs have a suppressed Flight response, meaning they are more likely to meet danger or resistance with violence; furthermore, they seem to have blunted affect, a sign of underdeveloped social structures. So far, however, no tangible fossil evidence has emerged to support this theory, possibly due to the Ork proclivity towards bone-eating.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts42"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts42">With that context, the rest of Orcish beliefs and customs becomes a little easier to digest. Orc cultural priorities are, fundamentally, martial; however, this is distinct from being</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts45">militant</span><span class="rvts44">. Orcs do not wage war on their own behalf, nor do they seek bloodshed or conflict on their own judgement. Instead, Orc cultures tend to have the concept that best</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">translates to "Vow", which is that while Orcs are physically and mentally suited for violence and train relentlessly in the arts of war and personal combat, they entrust any actual warmaking to another, whom they judge to have a greater moral or strategic (often both) judgement. Given that the vast bulk of the Orc population lives within the Hobgoblin Satrapies, most often this means that a given Orc population, usually called a Tribe but also potentially a Village or Band (these distinction being tedious), will typically be pledged to the service of a Hobgoblin Sultan or Satrap of some renown. Usually, one member of the Tribe will be selected, or may be part of a family line, to be the "Warmaster" or "Warchief", who will be responsible for pledging the Tribe's allegiance to their "Master", with all the Tribe's Orcs being then pledged to that individual. Occasionally, the Vow is more personal, with a specific Orc warrior having declared themselves for a specific Master; often, this will be one or a small handful of Orcs chosen to serve as a personal bodyguard of a Very Important Hobgoblin. This is the way that most people outside of the Satrapies will lay eyes on an Orc; travelling in the company of Hobgoblin merchants or diplomats, providing around-the-clock protection. Often, these will be garbed in body concealing clothes, which serves two purposes; First, since an Orc who has made a personal pledge is expected to forsake all Tribal or Clan ties while in their service, the clothes serve to cover their distinctive body markings, showing all that their personal allegiance and glories mean nothing compared to their personal service. Second, it serves as a pretty practical way to deal with temperatures both irregularly hot and cold; while adapted to the heat and deserts of the Satrapies, it would be pretty embarrassing for a trained Orc warrior to start shaking, even if it's just because the temperature has dropped several dozen degrees below what they are used to.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">This Vow concept ties deeply with another concept cultural concept, most commonly translated as "Honor". This gets the idea across, although some Orcs will note that the term has a bit too much baggage from other cultures for which Honor is essentially a term for "retaining pride"... for example, in Hobgoblin culture. They generally don't phrase it that way, though. To be more accurate, the Honor of an Orc has less to do with their personal pride and more to do with, in short, the actions that they must, or must not, do in order to uphold their Vow. Should they fail to do so, they will have "Breached" their Honor, which reflects poorly on the Orc in question and their Tribe in general. Depending on the severity of the breach, the Orc may simply need to be reprimanded or punished, but particularly grievous breaches carry far more serious penalties; death, or worse, banishment.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Now, while most Tribes of Orcs agree on several key tenets of Honor, such as "Follow Orders from a Superior", "Do not murder tribekin", "Do not Flee unless commanded", etc etc, there are a staggering number of different interpretations of honor that can vary from Tribe to Tribe. Making an exhaustive list would be difficult, and largely useless without the foreknowledge of Tribal markings necessary to identify one, but for sake of example:</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Azure Twilight Tribe</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">The Azure Twilight tribe is one of a small number of "Megatribes", i.e. a set of orc tribes and villages which, although geographically separated, all ascribe to the same set of training doctrines, markings, and interpretation of Honor. Indeed, part of the reason for their widespread presence is the significant demand by various Sultans and Satraps for the services of an Azure Sky tribe, or a few of it's warriors, as their training is generally regarded as creating the most cunning, flexible, and skilled warriors in all of the Mainland Continent. Unfortunately (for the Sultans, that is), this skill comes at a cost; the Azure Twilight interpretation of Honor leaves their Warmasters numerous "escape clauses", orders or behaviors of their Master which indicates that they are no longer operating with the assumed Moral Authority which is demanded by a Vow, and as such that a Vow to them can no longer exist. Often, this occurs when a foolish or conceited Satrap gives an order that is obviously disastrous or against their best interest, and refuses to entertain any advice to the contrary. In this case, a Warchief may not refuse the order, technically, but rather proclaim that the Satrap has lost their authority with a display of madness, and instead immediately seek another Hobgoblin of high standing, usually a general or the Satrap's next of kin, to instead pledge to. Despite the existence of these Clauses, however, they are very rarely exercised, as doing so places a great deal of suspicion on the Warmaster; should it be judged later by elders that they sundered the Vow without sufficient cause, they will be summarily Banished and Marked, stripped of all Honor, found without Soul.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Fastened Shield Tribe</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">The Fastened Shield tribe is another Megatribe, although they are more commonly found in the harsher climes of the Northern Satrapies. To these Orcs, the Vow is ironclad, their Honor unbreakable; whatever the order, whatever the objective, whatever the means, they will achieve victory, or die trying. Their particular brand of combat, which is marked for it's brutality, speed, and ruthlessness, does give some Satraps pause, because while on paper it sounds good to have a cadre of troops who would gladly die to achieve your objective, a Satrap who uses such a strength carelessly may soon find themselves deprived of their investment. Still, there are always those Satraps and Sultans who are of a more ruthless bent who realize that sometimes the most expedient method to victory involves being able to throw meat into a grinder until it jams, and these find Fastened Shields perfectly suited for their needs. Others still simply favor their no-nonsense approach to warfare, particularly in the Northern Satrapies where they are used extensively in tunnel fighting against their longtime Dwarven foes; while their casualties may be higher than more patient or careful tribes, the reward they reap in severed beards more than makes up for it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Given Orcish culture's need for a strict adherence to Vow and Honor, most would likely assume that most Haff'Orcs one would meet outside of a Tribe or Warband to be dishonored or disgraced orcs, banished from orc society. While these unfortunate individuals do exist, they are much rarer than one might expect, as most serious infractions of honor carry the more merciful penalty of death, rather than banishment. Indeed, it's important to remember that, while the Hobgoblins seem to have a monopoly on Orcish service, to Orcs the true importance of the Vow is not to serve Hobgoblins, but instead to ensure that the violence and destruction they are capable of is being used by an individual of moral authority. There are a fair number of orcs, and a smaller, but countable, number of tribes, who have emigrated beyond the Satrapies, either due to a Sundered Vow, or being driven from the Satrapies by a vengeful Sultan, or being granted their freedom (an unusual case, but some Satraps get funny ideas from northern cultures...), or even the simple expedience of having been left adrift after their ward managed to kill himself with an overdose, a death that isn't exactly the guard's fault, but also leaves them in a tough predicament if there's not enough money to get home(this last one happens more often than you'd think).</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Because of this, the reaches of the Mainland Continent are sparsely populated with small groups of Orcs who have decided to give their Vow to an unusual master. For some, it may be the charismatic party leader who rescued them from a suspicious populace, or it might be the head of an Adventuring Company who accidentally purchased them, thinking they were freeing them from slavery, or it might be an isolated tribe who have pledged themselves to a Castle Kingdom, serving as a terribly effective set of shock troops. There are even known to be isolated Orcs who have dedicated their Vow to a High Priest (although rarely to a god; they prefer to receive orders from a more tangible source), becoming a Warcleric for their faith.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">And, indeed, there are those Orcs who believe that the entire system of Vow and Honor to be malarky, manufactured by the Early Hobgoblins to keep their brethren in line. These Orcs, it goes without saying, are considered to be Damned by other Orcs, doomed to wander The World soulless and dangerous, perhaps even reverting to an abomination. While such a transformation has never been directly witnessed, rumors abound of Orcs from more fanatical tribes who stalk the corners of the Mainland Continent, looking for such Soulless Orcs and preventing them from regressing... by any means necessary.</span></p>
