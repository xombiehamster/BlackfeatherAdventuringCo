            <h2>Spellcaster Licensure</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15">&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most broad-reaching duties of the Thaumaturigcal Society is their Spellcaster licensure. The Society provides a license to practice magic, which is essentially a stamp of the Society's approval on the activities of said caster- whether divine or arcane. The process for acquiring the license is fairly simple, and requires little cost on the part of the applicant. Generally, it consists of a witten application, interview, demonstration of casting ability, test on the rules of the Society (which generally involves responsible use of spellcasting,) and an oath to those rules. Those who attend an Arcane University, whether or not they graduate, are automatically licensed. Many of the larger nations require a license in order to practice magic or open a business relating to it. The Thaumaturgists maintain their own legal system, and prosecute casters who break their oaths. Many casters, however, resent the invasive nature of the license.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; There are many notable examples (which will soon be mentioned,) but even in "developed" nations there are those who resent the authority that the Society presumes to wield. Divine casters and spontaneous casters, in particular, sometimes view their abilities as innate or gifted to them by a higher authority, and do not believe a mortal institution should hold sway over them. Many of them refuse to sign on for a license at all. The Thaumaturgists do not have the authority to force someone to register, though arcane casters in particular will find it very difficult to use their magic as a business. If they are caught committing crime with magic, they also risk steeper sentences. Divine casters have it a little easier- Divine casters who serve a specific deity or church will usually find shelter there, as even the Thaumaturgists can't overrule a deity.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">There are some specific organizations that oppose the Spellcaster Licensure, listed here-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Blackfeather-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Though they aren't strictly against the registration, Blackfeather in no way requires their members to be licensed. Many of their casters are licensed, many are not. This is a point of contention between the two organizations, as Blackfeather has several extremely powerful unlicensed spellcasters. For the last few years, there has been sort of an uneasy agreement-&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackfeather agrees to control the casters, and the Thaumaturgists leave them alone. Blackfeather does an excellent job of self-policing, so this has generally not been a premier issue lately. In addition, Blackfeather is popular with the University system itself due to their excellent track record for defending and assisting researchers in the field.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Serpeggiare-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">This city-state in particular has resisted the influence of the Thaumaturgists. Their nobility views the licensure as a deep insult. Bloodline is extremely important to serpente, and they view spontaneous casting ability as their birthright. Given this and their historic distrust of organized magic, the serpente find the idea of submitting their bloodlines for the approval of a foreign power outright disgusting. Though their are licensed casters in the city (mostly serpente who operate outside the city with Silverscale,) no business whatsoever requires the license. The government in general does not let the Society operate within the city. This is something of an issue of contention between the two organizations, and many Society members believe it makes the city-state potentially extremely dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">This viewpoint also makes the serpente fans of a different magic-user organization, one that presumes much less and is much more polite. Serpeggiare is on much better terms with-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">The Union of Non-Evil Necromancers-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">It is nearly impossible for a necromancer to get a magic license- the process views necromancy itself as dangerous knowledge, and have been known to outright reject necromancers at first review, without so much as an interview. As such, the Union has its own process. Their process is not a license or registration- it is a membership. It presumes no spellcasting ability, nor does it list personal information about any of its members. They monitor spellcasters, and have their own standards for behavior to make sure that their membership does not get out of control. Their charter is very particular- though it does not place any restriction on alignment, race, life status, or even spellcasting ability, they do require that their members adhere to a strict code of ethics and do not directly participate in military conflicts (at least in capacity as a Union member, or as a representative of the Union.) Many spellcasters who resent the imposing nature of the Society have begun to instead become members of the Union. This infuriates the Society to no end, and they have been biting for a chance to put these "upstarts" in their place.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">The Primarchy</span><span class="rvts13">-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Thaumaturgical Society is currently accepting Forged spellcasters on a very limited basis (consisting of between zero and two Forged spellcasters at any given time, and comparatively few non-forged Primarchy spellcasters). This acceptance does not include the Primarch, any Masters of the Forges, or any construct currently taking the Primarch as the source of their divine energies. As the Primarchy both has and requires significantly more than zero spellcasters, this is something of a point of contention between the two organizations. &nbsp;It is worth noting that the Primarchy is highly accepting of Thaumaturgical representatives and members within its borders, provided they follow the local laws and guidelines on spellcasting behavior, and submit research proposals to the local review boards before any research attempts are made (especially if they involve constructs or construct creation); citizens of the Primarchy are encouraged to petition to join the Thaumaturgical Society where possible, but are usually reminded that sharing information on construct creation is strictly forbidden.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; As a general rule, the Society does not currently accept Forged spellcasters (or spellcasters trained by Forged spellcasters or academies) as "legitimate" spellcasters.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">The Allied Lycanthropic Tribes-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">Currently, the Society and the Academy out and out do not accept Lycanthropes as members. They view Lycanthropes as "dangerous magical creatures," and will not even look at applications from Lycanthropes. Though Lycanthrope arcane casters are somewhat uncommon, they maintain many divine casters. Mongrelfolk are not strictly forbidden from registering, but due to the unpopularity of the Society in the ALT, generally few do. Much of this conflict arises from the early clashes with the Thaumaturgist outpost and the early ALT. They never outright fought each other, but the personal clashes among their leadership lead to very cold relationships that are maintained to this day. For their part, the Lycans assisted greatly in evacuating Teelsburg and providing security to the survivors, but they were also partly responsible for the delay that allowed the attack to happen, and they also took the city for their own after the fall.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Given the history of their people, many Society members view it as inevitable that the Lycans will start another war of expansion. They refuse to associate with the country at all. Some Academy members disagree with this position. After the collapse, a few members made their home in Lycan territories- including a Professor who was expelled due to hidden Lycanthropy. They have been treated well, if suspiciously. However, their opinion is a minority. The Lycanthropes do not prevent the Society or their members from operating within their territory, including a research facility at the ruined city of Teelsburg. They tend to view Society members with suspicion, but do not unduly harass them- usually.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">The Dagonistic Republic</span><span class="rvts13">-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; The highly isolationist Dagnostic Republic does not currently participate in Arcane University recruitment or Thaumaturgical Society licensing, and usually refuses all members of either any entry into their national lands or waters. Arcane spellcasters from the Republic are typically trained at Miskatonic University, a small arcane education program located in the capital city. Due to their use of unlicensed spellcasting, their refusal to allow Society research or investigations to be conducted on their lands, and the strange thaumaturgical environment affecting the remnants of Dunwich Mountain and the surrounding seas (especially the Reef Diabolus, an extremely dangerous reef system populated by aquatic aberrations and exceptionally large crustaceans), the Thaumaturgical Society classifies this nation as a "Code Yellow: Unsafe Practices" zone, and strongly discourages entry into the area. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The Thaumaturgic Society also serves as the accrediting institution for Arcane Universities all over the world. &nbsp;Here is a partial list of these institutions of higher learning:</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">The Arcane University</span><span class="rvts13">-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; The original institution in the Elven Isles, this is what most think of when they speak of Arcane Universities in general. &nbsp;The modern linked and accredited college system grew out of their need for expansion after becoming the preferred method for teaching licensed arcane casters after the Wizard Wars. &nbsp;This is also the source of the stereotype of wizards residing in towers, and those towers being made of ivory. &nbsp;The Arcane University is actually housed in a series of towers built of magically shaped ivory taken from the teeth of giant whales. &nbsp;The highly cosmopolitan city around The Arcane University is that of Prikrivena Mjesto, the Magic City, which in Elvish also translates to "veiled city" in reference to the deep secrecy that has lingered around much of the ivory towers for centuries.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Cavern University-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">Located deep in the underlands, far beneath Serpeggarie and Tyrranburgh, is the unlit but bustling and fully accredited Cavern University. &nbsp;Cave of Learning, the town that grows around it is a part of no government, but actually answers to the university itself. &nbsp;This University was established to serve the population of cave dwelling halflings that reside in the underlands, and moved to a new location when their previous city suffered economic collapse. &nbsp;Cave U is an accredited institution, and students there are fully licensed to practice magic by the Thaumaturgical Society.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Opal University-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">Located in the Northern Satrapies, Opal University blends Thaumaturgical and Theological practices to a degree that is considered unseemly by most other Arcane practitioners, who tend to be more secular.&nbsp; Funded by a number of influential Sultans, the Opal University benefits from an abundance of funding, attracting professors from all across the Mainland Continent, at least as long as they can adhere to the University's strict regulations on behavior, worship, and acceptance of other Goblinoid cultural quirks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Thunderlance University-</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Located in the Dwarf-dominated Eastern Mountains, Thunderlance University distinguishes itself from its peers by being first and foremost a Military College.&nbsp; Although under Thaumaturgical Society guidelines, the use of Battlefield Magic is strongly regulated, the practices taught by the Thunderlance Faculty pay closer attention to the arts of Supply, Logistics, and Engineering than they do to regiment-sized fireballs.&nbsp; However, their supplementary classes on self-defense do make them one of the premier producers of Battle Casters on the Mainland.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts14">Upon character creation for a caster, it is suggested that the player decide whether or not their character has a license or not- or if they are instead Union members. This will in no way limit or penalize a character, but it may have an effect on story.</span></p>
