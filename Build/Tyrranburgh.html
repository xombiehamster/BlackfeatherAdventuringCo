            <h2>Tyrranburgh</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tyrranburgh is a small Drow city-state located in the Underlands region beneath the Southern Mountain Range. Founded by Tyrra Caligo, an outcast scion of the Caligan Drow dynasty, the micronation stands as one of the few Drow settlements to survive the ongoing Lolth/Lawlth Religious Schisms virtually unscathed. It is one of few Drow settlements below the Equatorial landmark, and one of a scant number of subterranean city-states in the Southern Mountain range that aren't Dwarven or dwarven-aligned.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drow are notoriously xenophobic, especially in regards to revealing historical details. However, external analysis and reports from former "slave" denizens of Tyrranburgh suggest that the city-state was founded eighty years ago, as part of a mass exodus of Caligan relatives and thanes from Nowherefjord at the beginning of the Schism. The ruins of Nowherefjord leave little clues as to the soon-to-be ruler's origins before this migration, but her immediate seizure of the Jarl-ship (a corruption of the Dwarven title "Earl") and her use of the Nowherefjord ruling family's name (the feminine of Caligo, rather than the masculine or neuter of lower branches) suggest high status.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tyrranburgh rests in the pro-Lawlth spectrum of the ongoing religious debate, with a strong pro-Lawlth clergy and strict rulings preventing religious internecine warfare on the part of the city's leadership--rulings which appear to be obeyed by the general populace, in spite of their characteristicly chaotic Drow behavior. Part of this originates from the destabilization of the Lolth clergy in the early days of the settlement; part of it also originates from the character of those willing to follow Jarl Caligo out of Nowherefjord to begin with. Even so, chaotic behavior remains quite prevalent, causing this guide to maintain a Orange-level travel advisory for any visitors to Tyrranburgh and associated provinces. Travelers are advised to expect low-danger chaos, such as prankster behavior, unusual (though relatively nonlethal) laws, deliberately confusing building and street layout, and of course spiders. Lots and lots of spiders.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The great distance and stress of the migration also caused an unusual change in the social dynamics of Tyrranburgh Drow society; the slave system common to Nowherefjord and similar Drow settlements appears to have been dissolved, and the former slaves in question integrated into local society as a caste below or about equal to the Drow menial caste. Thus, unlike almost all Drow settlements, slavery and the slave trade are technically illegal, though the punishments are currently fairly mild, and usually involve fines and seizure of property. This change has caused consternation for both the Drow menials and the former slaves, each of whom consider the other to be beneath them in effective social hierarchy, and leaving the slaves with the loss of numerous laws and comforts guaranteed to them under more traditional Drow law. Integration between the two groups has been somewhat difficult, though at this point, direct conflict is uncommon. Non-drow--especially humans or former slaves--are typically referred to as "Reds," in reference to the red hair coloration common to humans in the northern areas the Caligan family originates from.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the overall changes to typical Drow society that allowed Tyrranburgh to stabilize, the Jarl also instituted neighborhood-sized political units to help less well-furnished Drow neighborhoods contribute to the political system. In practice, this has resulted in little direct change, though these political alliances--referred to generally as "tribes"--have weakened the power of wealthy Drow nobles to control the lower class workers around them. In addition, they serve as an outlet for the lower classes' Chaotic nature. Tiny turf wars between tribes aren't uncommon.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For the past eighty years, Tyrranburgh has been engaged in a long-standing cold war with the neighboring nation of Serpeggiare. The exact causes of this conflict are unknown, though it is quite evident that both nations (which share a border in the confined area of the Underlands) compete for local resources, and there is some evidence of political intrigue and assassination attempts on both sides. While this cold war has yet to escalate into an open conflict, both sides appear to have geared up for such an event, and military recruitment in Tyrranburgh matches that of raiding Drow nations in the north. Both sides have also attempted to recruit local micronations into alliances against the other, with little success.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The city itself is isolated from most of the rest of the Underlands, built into a large, dome-shaped volcanic pocket a little separate from the main thoroughfares. Careful Drow construction has hidden the easy access points from external view. There is at least one trade thoroughfare available, though its exact location is concealed, and travelers are usually taken through one of a number of hidden side thoroughfares that can be blocked up at a moment's notice. As Tyrranburgh is a relatively isolationist and autonomous city-state, this has had little effect on their already-small trade agreements. A small settlement outside of the city proper, called Alfodr's Gate, serves as the main trade hub for any caravans passing through the area.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Visual reports describe Tyrranburgh as a fairly large city, with numerous tall buildings composed of varying hues of jade and jade brick, on a series of flat landings overlooking a wide canyon. Constant wind from the canyon itself, combined with polished jade plates spotting the overhead dome and the phosphorescent fungal patches that serve as Tyrranburgh's main light sources, provide a view that is often described as "like entering Tarterus itself, and finding an empty city within." As befits its descriptor, residents often greet visitors by staring at them in abject horror, screaming, and turning invisible en masse. If you witness such an occurrence, remain calm and listen for patches of uncontrolled giggling. This will assure you that nothing is wrong.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As is traditional for a Northern Drow Dynasty, the military of Tyrranburgh is divided up along three lines: the Disir, the Dynastic (or Caligan) Guard, and the armies of the Thanes.</span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Disir are a small, elite order of male Drow, by tradition dedicated to the protection and defense of the temples, schools, and noble houses of the city; they serve as a disciplined neutral party immune to the dangerous politics of bickering Drow Matriarchs. To most of Drow society, killing the Disir as part of an intrigue operation is considered dishonorable and cowardly--but for the upper ranks, honor rarely limits ambition. While all Disir have at least some experience in the clergy, members often specialize in particular defensive capabilities, such as trap design, healing, or heavy infantry support. An experienced cleric by the name of Gunn Mercerio heads the Jarl's personal household, and will be in charge of training her heirs once said heirs are produced.</span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Caligan Guard are the soldiers of the Jarl herself, sworn and dedicated to her house and her house alone. In Tyrranburgh, they serve as the closest equivalent of a police force, and have a reputation for surprising leniency and exceptionally high bribery prices. The current head of the Caligan Guard is Juliani Esposito, a veteran soldier with a half-caste parentage and (fittingly) Dwarven levels of tenacity.</span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The armies of the Thanes are the armed forces belonging to the smaller noble houses in Tyrrnaburgh. These armies tend to be larger in total than the Caligan Guard, but are often less coordinated, and tend towards bickering and infighting in ways that match the bickering and infighting of their parent houses. One of the most famous of these is a division known as Knight's Wolfspiders, led by Knight, an orc and former adventurer who was raised to a noble seat by the Jarl in return for "services rendered." This makes him extremely unpopular with the rest of the city's nobles. The Wolfspiders are known for skilled hit-and-fade tactics and unusual ferocity in direct combat, as well as a tendency towards double-weapon fighting. Their uniforms are marked by blood-red spidersilk sashes, traced in bronze wire with their name and rank.</span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Northern Drow armies typically focus on stealth tactics, preferring to hit their opponents in precise locations and retreat or disappear before the enemy can retaliate. Crossbow specialists are the most common form of infantry, though all Drow receive at least some longsword training in their youth. Tyrranburghian tactics appear to fit this paradigm. Drow armies also feature Giant Spider and Riding Bat cavalry units; Tyrranburgh's bat herd is unusually large for a nation of its size, and a large portion of this herd appears to be combat trained. Due to the small numbers of large subterranean insectoids in this area, the city's Large Spider dens are fairly small, though humanoid sized and smaller spiders are still common work animals and household pets.</span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike surface nations, Drow nations like Tyrranburgh do not make use of flags and banners to indicate a particular lord's support in large-scale combat. Instead, Drow combat armor typically features a particular marker or symbol that connects its owner to a house or unit, and officers decorate their faces and helmets in a paste made from compressed phosphorescent fungus. This provides a glowing symbol of leadership that assists in tying units together, and an intimidation factor against enemy forces. Veils are typically used to prevent the design from interfering with stealth tactics. The principle design of the Caligan army in this area is a Drow skull, usually painted on or over the face, with varying colors based on unit. Soldiers preferring open helmets tend to highlight their hair and teeth in similar colors.</span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tyrranburgh's position within the Helviti canyon gives it good access to several veins of jade and adamantium, as well as small veins of gold (in the form of gold-silver and gold-copper natural alloys), quartz, pyrite, and trace amounts of silver and sapphire gemstones. Tyrranburgh's primary exports are jade, adamantium, spider silk, and fungal products such as glow ink and mushroom flour. While Tyrranburgh's economy is focused on self-sufficiency, recent years of expansion have resulted in increasing trade between this city and its Underland neighbors. As Tyrranburgh grows, it will most likely be force to give up its isolationist practices.</span></p>
