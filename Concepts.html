<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">To call Serpeggiare society tumultuous would be an understatement. The central government, while strong in theory, in practice it is weak and decentralized. It changes frequently and unexpectedly. Further, nearly everything- from policing, to military, medicine, and fire control is held in private hands, frequently with competing business and little to no regulation. If you are a have, you could lose it easily. If you are a have-not, you have no one to turn to but yourself. This massive riot of a society leads to intense competition. While this competition can lead to vibrant growth and adaptability, it can also lead to intense infighting. With so many bricks built on so many different and independent systems, Serpente society can be unpredictable indeed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts27">Origins: Children of the Snake Gods</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">The Serpente religion, the Cult of Drakaulos, was the original founding body for Serpente civalization. The people of Serpeggiare originally hailed from the original nation of Serpente, Drakwyn. Drakwyn sprawled across hundreds of miles of jungle, and was ruled over by the leaders of the Cult. The original Serpeggiare was a small town on the edges of Drakwyn territory.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The Cult of Drakaulos is still a prominent fixture in the daily lives of most Serpente. While outsiders may find the midnight rituals, blood ceremonies, and dark orgies confusing and frightening, it is simple routine for the Serpente.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The clergy of the Cult are the most strict followers of the caste system. Only Purebloods may be clerics. They pursue and frequently attack non-purebloods who practice divine magic in the name of Drakaulos (Or one of his dozens of sub-deities.)</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts27">Transitions: We Were Betrayed</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare was always different, culturally, than the rest of Drakwyn. Where most of Drakwyn was theocratic and militaristic, Serpeggiare traded freely with its non-Serpente neighbors. Serpeggiare’s independence grew steadily, until finally two years ago, under the rule of Duke Sylan Lipocauda, they seceded.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The Drakwyn empire reacted furiosly, and sent a massive invasion force. The current spymaster and chief advisor, Niccolai Melanoro, was the first to see the writing on the wall. He advised the Duke of a hidden cavern to which refugees could be temporarily located.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Duke Lipocauda, knowing that defeat was inevitable, ordered the flight. The Mercenary families organized a defense, and held as long as they could. Most of the city was able to retreat before the walls fell, but fall they did.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">In the chaos, the Mercenary houses took many losses. Most of the city’s inhabitants lost a large amount of their wealth and possessions. Duke Lipocauda himself had stayed in order to personally manage the evacuation. He was killed by a stray Trebuchet hit.</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts27">Foundations: Where did the sky go?</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">When the Serpente reached the cavern, they decided that they could not go back. Sylan’s sister, Adelaide, became Duchess. Melanoro survived, and is still chief advisor. The city is rebuilding, slowly, in their new home, but rebuilding is difficult to say the least.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The new city was never supposed to be more than a temporary home. The original fortress was too small to hold the whole city, and many of the lower class have been expanding a system of canals and wharves into the shallow nearby lake.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The Serpente are having trouble adapting to a world with no sky. Few of their pack animals survived the transition, and only a small amount of stored food. They are used to a varied surface diet, and have been subsisting on fungus and caught fish. It is barely enough to live on.</span><br/><span class="rvts27">Calling: Glory of the Future and Past</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare is a city in flux. It is growing at a rapid rate, and the citizens are already reforging the things that make them who they are. Artists are finding new things to paint with, cooks are finding new ingredients to make food palatable, and businesses are finding new ventures in which to expand.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Though they are in a precarious position, the ambitions among the Serpente see the new potential. For the first time, they are self-governing. They can expand as they see fit, rather than at the allowance of a restrictive theocracy. The can grow and create without restriction. They can trade with (and swindle) neighbors without fear of repricussion. The creative, the ambitious, and the predatory are all chomping at the bit to exploit all this new opportunity has to offer.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">At the same time, people are struggling to figure out what to do with the old ways. Despite their radical outlooks, most citizens of Serpeggiare still value the old ways, the old traditions. Even though they were betrayed by their leaders, most still worship the Snake Gods. Many are struggling to balance out the tradition, the betrayal, and the future in their minds.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts27">Territory Aspects</span><br/><span class="rvts28">City On the Water</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare sits on a large freshwater underground lake. The lake is heated by nearby geothermal vents, and is both warm and abundant with life. It is the primary source of food, water, and light for the city, though much water also comes from the large freshwater spring in the high city (Which this aspect also covers.) The lake may contain many secrets, both good and bad.</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">City Planning is for Chumps</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The low city in particular is a haphazard community. There was no official city planning involved, and buildings were constructed with no regard for structure, navigability, or zoning. Residential, commercial, and industrial mix together with wild abandon. This makes the city hard to navigate at best, particularly for foreigners.</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">This City Never Sleeps</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The Serpente are nocturnal, and as such adapted well to the dark world of underground. The city does not particularly work on a day/night schedule, people simply work or play when they can. As such, the city is a constant tumult of activity at all hours. It waxes and wanes, but something is always going on.</span></p>
