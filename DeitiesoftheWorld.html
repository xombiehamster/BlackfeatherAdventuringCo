            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Entities of vast, unimaginable power, the true nature of Deities are difficult for the mortal races of The World to comprehend, even with several institutions working around the sundial on cutting-edge theology.&nbsp; Even more frustrating, what revelations have been discovered often appear to have conflicting, even contradictory conclusions, which may be evidence of the Deities themselves tampering with any attempt to understand them, but is more easily attributed to the fact that, frankly, Theological Institutions have a bad habit of becoming entrenched in Dogma.&nbsp;</span><br/><span class="rvts13">Nevertheless, there are some facts about the nature of Divinity and the connections between Gods and Mortals that are generally accepted by most; for clarity, it should also be mentioned that the term "Mortal" here does apply to outsiders, undead, and many constructs, as in spite of their impressive longevity, there are always ways to ultimately destroy such creatures.</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: decimal;">
<li value="1" class="rvps5"><span class="rvts14">The Gods Desire Faith</span><br/><span class="rvts13">It is clear that, in some capacity, the number of mortals who believe in, worship, or otherwise give thought to a deity, the more powerful and influential it becomes.&nbsp; The exact reason for this is unknown, although there are a profusion of theories; some hold that the number of followers a god has gives it a degree of bargaining power with other gods; others maintain that more belief draws a god closer to The World, allowing it to exert more influence; there are even those with the esoteric theory that the beliefs of mortals somehow metaphysically "defines" the deities, and the more followers who believe in a god's omnipotent power, the more true this becomes.</span><br/><span class="rvts13">Whichever of these may be true, they have the same impact; the vast majority of gods desire more followers, and as such most faiths take a proactive stance to recruiting and converting others to their following.</span></li>
<li value="2" class="rvps5"><span class="rvts14">The Gods Are Not Here</span><br/><span class="rvts13">Many faiths tend to word this more positively, but the general idea is thus; for whatever reasons, the deities of The World cannot manifest directly within the realm of mortals, or in any plane so far discovered by mortals.&nbsp; Transitively, mortals cannot directly interact with deities.&nbsp; In very basic terms, it seems like the "rules" that govern the realities of mortals and the realities of the gods are fundamentally incompatible, and as such any attempts by gods to impose their will on the mortal realm must be performed through their chosen and empowered agents; mortals to whom the gods speak and empower to allow them to pursue their will on The World.&nbsp; However, the full extent of their ability to work through their chosen is somewhat contested; after all, there is a clearly apparent causal link between the potency of magic a follower of a god can manifest and the amount of practice they have had with manifesting it.&nbsp; A prevailing theory among most clergy is that the gods, in their wisdom, do not grant their followers more power than they can handle, lest disaster reign, but there are others who maintain that the gods cannot actually dictate how the power they grant is used, only whether or not it is granted, and most of the potent usage is more evidence of the empowered individual's will than of any direct divine intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li value="3" class="rvps5"><span class="rvts14">The Gods Are Infinite</span><br/><span class="rvts13">This is another thing that is often rephrased by certain faiths, but this refers not just to the fact that the gods seem capable of doing or knowing anything given opportunity and followers to do so, but also to the fact that there are more gods than you can shake a stick at.&nbsp; Modern Theologians are constantly discovering the presence of new gods, or discovering evidence of old gods of extinct religions, or discovering evidence that one god may have mutated into another god over time; this final discovery is frequently hailed both as being completely obvious and utterly blasphemous.&nbsp; As part of the above-mentioned contradictory conclusions, the gods themselves seem to be extremely cagey about their infinite nature, although whether this is deliberate obfuscation or because mortal minds have no conceptual analog for what really happens is difficult to tell.&nbsp; The main takeaway is that it is impossible to ever make a complete list of all the gods that may exist.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Beyond these three basic rules, it is difficult to get any great deal of agreement about the desires of the gods, the nature of divinity, or so forth between any two religions.&nbsp; Indeed, even for these three commonly accepted rules, there are exceptions, such as&nbsp;Emperyan, who claims to need no faith, or the nature of Demigods, beings who seem to have inexplicable, divine powers, yet are fully capable of interacting directly with the Mortal Realm.&nbsp; Exceptions like these are generally accepted as the reason that most Theologian Monasteries are also famed for their mastery of the arts of Brewery.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">For the purposes of simplicity, this guide Separates the gods into two rough categories: The Greater Deities, who boast widespread acceptance, or at least recognition, as powerful gods, and the Lesser Deities, whose worship is usually isolated to smaller communities or niche followers.&nbsp; This guide makes no effort to make value judgments on the religions in question; this is all just a numbers game.&nbsp; If you have an issue with your deity's position in this list, please direct complaints to your local missionary, and tell them to get back to work.</span></p>
