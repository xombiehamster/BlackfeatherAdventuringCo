            <h2>Ik'Kek Children</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">Children of the Loving Mother, the Radiant Queen Ik’Kek’Kik’Os, Ik’Kek take the name for their kind from her, as was the tradition back in the Old Homes. &nbsp;Ever since the Great Migration, their home has been found in the capacious tunnels and caves of the Underlands, particularly in the teeming hive of New Home. &nbsp;Though descended from another plane of existence(which one specifically is not entirely certain, but safe bets are on Mechanus or Axis based on descriptions provided), Ik’Kek’Kik’Os fled to the Material Plane to save her children, her drones, and herself from a calculated sacrifice plotted by her mother, who would have gladly seen Ik’Kek’Kik’Os’ entire brood decimated just to gain an upper hand in the endless Colony Wars of their kind. Although the adjustment to the vagaries and lawlessness of the Material have been difficult on the Queen and her Children, at least on this plane her Children are free to toil and build under her watchful and loving eyes, free from the machinations of other, greater hives. However, the Material has proven to have numerous threats of its own; Plagues, intrigues, wars and even economic depressions(somewhat literally) have claimed innumerable Ik’Kek as the price for their freedom. &nbsp;Though the Loving Mother continues to weep for each of her Children lost, her heart remains strong, and through this her brood shall continue to flourish.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">Ik'Kek society generally draws a line between three distinct types of Ik'Kek; The Queen, in all her ponderous, radiant splendor; her consort Drones, who are not as physically imposing as the Mother but are still quite large and fearsome in their own right; and the most populous by far, her Children, about whom most of the following is written.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Physical Description</span><span class="rvts16">: Most Ik’Kek are lithe and gangly looking, a natural consequence of their insectoid appearance; a hardened, rigid carapace, which comes in all the colors of a mud-covered rainbow, coats much of their bodies, with thin, leathery protodermis at joints and digits allowing for marvelous flexibility. &nbsp;In addition to this general construction, they are also blessed with a wide array of creepy bug bits; Their thorax/general chest area is studded with tiny vestigial limbs incapable of much more than holding objects, &nbsp;their mouths are largely protected by rigid mandibles that move only when ingesting(which is happy news since the inside of an Ik’Kek mouth is not a pretty sight), and their abdomen doesn’t project far enough to be a tail, but projects too far to be comfortably considered a proper posterior. &nbsp;As a natural consequence, their appearance is somewhat unnerving to the Surfacelanders who are more accustomed to people of mammalian, or at least reptilian, descent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">However, through the pressures of both acclimation to the material plane and the selective breeding of the Radiant Queen, each successive generation of Ik’Kek Children have become smoother, stronger, and overall less hideous than their forebears. &nbsp;The modern Ik’Kek Child, who stands just a bit shorter than a male human on average, could pass as humanoid given sufficiently heavy robes or armor, as even the unusual segmented joints of their Elder siblings have simplified to the typical bipedal design. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">The youngest of her Children have even started sprouting an unusual quality; fully formed eyeballs, with pupils and everything. &nbsp;It remains to be seen whether this helps matters or not…</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Society</span><span class="rvts16">: Ik’Kek society would be considered, on it’s surface, rigid, tyrannical, and even inhumane by many other cultures, but in truth the best way to think of it is as less a civilization, more an enormous family. &nbsp;Ik’Kek Children love their mother fanatically, and only the most twisted of these could ever bring themselves to harm her in any way. &nbsp;As a natural consequence of this devotion and their natural predisposition to orderly behavior (hardly surprising, given their origins), Ik’Kek rarely concern themselves with details such as “personal fulfillment” or “upward mobility” when it comes to professions. &nbsp;Indeed, many Ik’Kek fall into lifelong professions due to simple need for a new set of claws to work in any given field. &nbsp;As such, most Ik’Kek learn their profession while on the job, with older Ik’Kek imparting wisdom and instruction on any newcomers until they perform the role to their satisfaction. While this works well enough when filling menial roles such as digging, construction, agriculture and so on, it doesn’t work so well in any field which involves significant complexity as, overall, the Ik’Kek mind is not as well developed for complex concepts or technical minutia. &nbsp;This can lead to an unusual circumstance where the more cerebral positions, like accountant, lawyer, researcher or artist (many of these being roles that have only very recently been introduced into the Ik’Kek economy as part of “Acclimation Initiatives” forwarded by the Loving Mother) are perennially understaffed due to poor retention rate and lack of interest among the population in having work that doesn’t involve a great deal of simple toil or menial drudge work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">Because of this, the Ik’Kek hives that reside predominantly in the Underlands are often considered poor and primitive by many modern standards, but few Ik’Kek feel the pressure of this poverty; By the work of their own limbs, they have enough to eat, sufficient shelter, plenty of tasks to keep them occupied, and only very rarely are they brutally depopulated in a massive swarm of culling violence. &nbsp;What more could an Ik’Kek want?</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">That said, with the growth of the aforementioned later generations of Ik’Kek Children, this dynamic has begun to shift; the Initiatives pushed by Ik’Kek’Kik’Os have finally started to gain some ground, resulting in some of the first examples of Ik’Kek Art, Theater, and even Music ever created, although it can frequently be difficult to differentiate exactly whether the final production is Art, Theater, or even perhaps Music. &nbsp;Nonetheless, it has led to the growth of a small streak of individuality borne into the new Children of the Queen, a fact that has caused no small amount of tension in her Elder Children. Still, time will tell whether this new and unusual breed will ultimately become the new face of Ik’Kek society.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Relations</span><span class="rvts16">: Few other nations have had an opportunity to form formal relations with the Ik’Kek, as their remote location in the Underlands and natural inclination towards self-sufficiency gives limited opportunities for most of the nations of The World to interact with them… and, if that wasn’t enough, there’s also the fact that they’re freaky bug people. &nbsp;Indeed, the few Ik’Kek that have made their way to the surface have typically done so under explicit instructions from The Mother to conduct formal diplomatic contact or make trade negotiations; therefore, most Surfacers are unaware that they even exist, or aware of them only as a passing curiosity. &nbsp;Still, for those who do interact with them, they typically find that the Ik’Kek are reserved but diligent workers, craftschildren, and negotiators, although admittedly slow by most standards.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Alignment and Religion</span><span class="rvts16">: By nature, the Ik’Kek are an organized, communal species that focuses on the needs of society over the individual, but lacking other ethical imperatives, resulting in most to be Lawful Neutral. &nbsp;Those that are exposed to the cultures or ethics of other races and cultures, however, often find curious or intriguing concepts that can sway their thinking, although breaking the stubborn orderliness of the Ik’Kek mind is a daunting task. &nbsp;As part of this cultural exposure, the Ik’Kek Children have now been exposed to the concepts of faith for some time, but continually struggle with the fact that each and every Ik’Kek is brought into the world with a supreme figure deserving of reverence and service already built into their Psyche; the Loving Mother, Ik’Kek’Kik’Os. This causes natural problems for any Ik’Kek attempting to embrace or even understand the worship of other gods, as their attempts to devote themselves to a deity often clashes with their instinctual worship of their Radiant Queen. &nbsp;Instead, they have a much easier time incorporating more generalist faiths such as worship of nature or ancestral spirits, as these faiths fishtail nicely with their communal nature and veneration of their Loving Mother as a font of life and wellbeing. That said, the Ik'Kek that walks the path of faith is an unusual one, as most are more fulfilled contributing to the wellbeing of the Hive in more tangible ways.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts16">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Adventurers</span><span class="rvts16">: Nearly every Ik’Kek Child that sets off to find its fortune in The World has done so at the behest of the Radiant Queen, either directly or through initiatives and policies that seek to further root the place of the Ik’Kek people on the Material plane. &nbsp;Often, the Child in question will be given a term limit or specific goal in mind to seek, achieve, and then return to the Hive in order to share what they have learned, earned and accomplished; however, there are those that are given more… permanent assignments. &nbsp;Sadly, these Ik’Kek are often those who are sent forth simply because there is, by the standards of the Ik’Kek anyway, something wrong with their thinking or behavior that makes them a poor fit for Ik’Kek society. &nbsp;While in the Old Homes such “defects” would be discreetly repurposed, such is the Love of the Loving Mother that instead she opts to release these Children to their own devices, hoping that they can find somewhere that they truly belong.</span></p>

<li class="rvps32"><span class="rvts55">Legacy of Claws: </span><span class="rvts16">Children are descended from outsiders that were often born with an impressive array of natural weaponry. Although the modern child lacks the razor-sharp talons and sawing mandibles of their predecessors, the chitinous spikes, digging claws, and vestigial pincers they bear ensures that a Child is never truly unarmed. &nbsp;All Children gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, and their Unarmed attacks deal Slashing damage instead of Bludgeoning.</span></li>
<li class="rvps32"><span class="rvts55">Skilled</span><span class="rvts16">: Though poor at logical deduction or complex concepts, the orderly Ik’Kek mind is still quite capable of rote memorization of skills. &nbsp;Children gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.</span></li>

<li class="rvps32"><span class="rvts55">Darkvision</span><span class="rvts16">: Children can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.</span></li>

<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="rvps32"><span class="rvts55">Child of the Underwar</span><span class="rvts16">: Born during the tumultuous times of the Underwar, these children were birthed with the purpose of defending the Hive against those who would have sought to destroy them. &nbsp;Although the war was over before many of these Children came to full maturity, they still remember the knowledge imparted to them. &nbsp;Children with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the orc and dwarven subtypes. &nbsp;Additionally, against humanoid creatures with the dwarven subtype, they gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC and +2 racial bonus on Combat Maneuver checks made to grapple creatures of that subtype. &nbsp;This bonus stacks with the +1 bonus on attack rolls. This racial trait replaces Skilled.</span></li>
<li class="rvps32"><span class="rvts55">Elder Child</span><span class="rvts16">: Born either before or shortly after the Migration to the Prime Material, or very rarely to this day, &nbsp;these Elder Children still carry much of the essence of their original plane. &nbsp;A Child with this racial trait changes their type to Outsider with the Native subtype. &nbsp;Such Children were taught little of the languages of the Prime Material: They begin play only knowing Axiomatic, although those with Bonus Languages may pick from Common, Elven, Serpente and Undercommon.</span></li>
<li class="rvps32"><span class="rvts55">Mawchild</span><span class="rvts16">: Born from the union of the most brutal of the Loving Mother’s Warrior Drones, these Children are born with powerful mandibles designed to crack chitin and rend flesh, as well as with a fierce temperament. &nbsp;Children with this racial trait gain a Bite attack that deals 1d4 damage, and if their hit points fall below zero, but the Child is not yet dead, they can continue to remain conscious. &nbsp;If they do, they are staggered, and will lose 1 hit point at the end of every round they remain conscious. &nbsp;They still die when reduced to negative hit points equal to their Constitution Score. &nbsp;This replaces Legacy of Claws and Skilled.</span></li>
