            <h2>Lolth/Lawlth</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<h3 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts19">Lolth/Lawth</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts21">Chaotic Evil/Lawful Evil</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lolth, a divine being typically depicted as a Drow female torso attached to an oversized arachnid body, has been the premier deity of Drow and other subterranean elf varieties since the dawn of recorded Drow history. As a primary deity of worship, her portfolio overlaps those of other existing deities--her followers believe that she covers power, destruction, trials of flesh and will, intrigue and deception, entropy and instability, the darkness of Underland domains, and spiders. Because of the connection with their deity, many Drow cultures consider spiders (particularly large ones) to be sacred animals, and domesticated spiders are used in Drow cultures as trained guardians, living holy symbols, sources of industrial material, sacrificial animals, sacrifice-receiving animals, or even household pets.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modern divinity experts speculate that Lolth may be a corruption or modification of Calestros, the typical deity of surface elves, whose erratic behavior and pride-related gifts to her people match with Lolth's chaotic--and some would say insane--tendencies. Still others suggest that she may be a conglomeration of Calestros worship and Bellaphex worship, seeing as Bellaphex holds sway over similar chaotic tendencies, and would provide the bloodlust and destructive urges the Lolth clergy advocate. They also maintain that Bellaphex' infamous hatred of civilizations shines through in Drow cultures that raid and pillage their neighbors for slaves and profit, or risk internal collapse with murderous politics. Indeed, some Divinity specialists suggest that Lolth's very appearance illustrates this--half an elf and half a monster, shoved together haphazardly, and given sway over a people naturally loyal to one god but born in the promised domain of another. Communities containing these experts often report rising spider levels in ensuing weeks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The past century has marked a lasting internal schism within numerous Drow cultures as to the proper worship and behavior of Lolth, particularly in regards to living in and maintaining a large-scale society. This schism--dubbed "the Lawlthite Heresies" by one segment, and "the Revelation" by another--originated from an attempt by several smaller subfactions of Lolth worship to sieze public and private support, and attempt to steer the direction of religious discussion in the upper ranks of the Lolth clergy. These subfactions, dubbed "Lawlthites," appear to follow a significantly more lawful structure and code of worship than standard, but maintain their worship is dedicated towards the same deity--and moreover, that law and structure are necessary for the continued survival of Drow society.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After more than a century of internal conflict and violence, the two major factions of Lolth/Lawlth worship have effectively split; major Drow settlements have thrown in their support for one side or the other, with the largest and oldest generally supporting traditional Lolth worship, and the younger settlements (some of which were formed during the schism) siding with the new Lawlth subfactions. In order to maintain a degree of solidarity, the Lawlthite factions have generally agreed to refer to their deity by the more archaic spelling (hence, Lawlth); the Lolthite factions have generally agreed to refer to the other factions as "heretics." Clerics of the "effectively two" deities share similar spells capabilities, with some notable differences; these differences seem to accumulate as time progresses, and the Lawlthites solidify their viewpoints and followers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Lawlth: Darkness, Evil, Law, Trickery</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Both the Lolthite and Lawlthite factions share similar views on most aspects of their diety--the cunning and pride she gives to her subjects, or the aspects of the Underlands she represents, which can both hinder her people and allow them to thrive. The primary differences are in terms of outlook. The Lolthites view their god as a predatory god, and believe that all individuals must prey on each other until the strongest lead. The Lawlthite clergy state that it is the struggle for survival that their god "feeds" from, and destruction for destruction's sake begets only loss; instead, they must present the creativity and drive of the spider, and try everyday to reshape their world--and that creation depends on Order and Law. For Lawlthites, the social contract is the basis for society; for Lolthites, the social contract is the means by which individuals can feed off each other. The actual nitty-gritty is significantly more complicated than this, and debates as to the exact nature of Lolth's teaching have echoed on for centuries.</span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Lawlth: Tyrrany, Deception</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, while both segments view similar concepts as signs of their deity, their views differ as to their actual meaning. Lawlthites maintain that the harsh demands Lolth places on them (in the form of survival in the Underlands, and life on this plane in general) are part of an overall hierarchy of fealty, ranging from the slaves at the bottom to the nobles and lords of Drow society at the top, and that they therefore "owe" the stress and pains of their existence in exchange for the blessings and promises Lawlth returns. Lolthites instead believe that the harshness of life is the "source" of these blessings, and the only way to both gain more blessings and spread Lolths power is through experience and inflicting pain and surviving it.</span></p>
