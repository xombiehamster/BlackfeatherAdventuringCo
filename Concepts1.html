<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts41">Transitions</span><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting while the Getting's Good</span><br/><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyrra Caligo, of the Caligo family, had managed to dodge the vast majority of the growing cataclysm. A rebellious youth (which her parents considered a “blessing from Lolth”, up until her teenage years), she fled her ancestral home of Nowherefjord, hoping to conquer a realm for herself among the “weak and puny” surfacers. Now an adult and seasoned adventurer, she returned home for brief visit to discover the majority of her immediate family unsurprisingly dead (that’s politics for you), and the rest embroiled in the onrushing conflict. A few old servants and supporters recognized her as a potential “beacon of law” amidst the chaos (a fact that annoys her barbaric nature to no end); in response, her Matriarch officially disowned her, and sent a few troops to ensure her demise.</span><br/><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyrra responded by seizing as much of the family fortune as she could, grabbing her supporters that still remained, and meandering off to form her own nation. Most stayed with her out of desperation, certain that to return to Nowherefjord would mean certain demise; many, however, came to see her as a bastion of salvation--either the base from which a lawful society could grow, or as a leader who might allow a few liberalizing measures in the name of forming a stable new society.</span><br/><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trip was far from easy, and the new nation parted with significant treasures, people, and traditions as they made their way here. Old rules regarding slaves were relaxed; old hatreds between classes and families weakened. They arrived in what was to be Tyrranburgh a changed group--no longer simply a mass of refugees, shoved together at the last minute, but independent groups with their own agendas, and capable of working as a coordinated whole.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts41">Foundations</span><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sneaky Jerkitudery</span><br/><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sneaking, and jerkitudery, are inborn Drow traits; even separatists such as the people of what would be Tyrranburgh could not and would not try to escape them. Even the creation of Tyrranburgh itself could not help but be tainted. The Drow walled off their new home from the rest of the Underdark: they isolated a single, deep cavern, sealed the obvious entrances, and filled the surrounding with dozens of secret boltholes. They polished the walls of their new home, patched it with phosphorescent fungus, and constructed a massive fortress of glittering stone in its center--designed to look as little like the outside cavern as possible. They sent out scouting parties to harass and beguile all nearby travelers, using tricks, traps, and haunting illusions to keep the neighbors afraid of their new domain--all without causing any actual injury, for that might attract interest or anger.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts41">Calling</span><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order’s Foundation</span><br/><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of Drow, as ordained by Lolth, is one of constant, competitive division; in her heart, every Drow holds her own goals above those of her fellows. The nature of Drow, as ordained by Lolth, is also one of constant chaos and deceit; in her heart, every Drow feels the urge to sow confusion, to foil dreams, to topple empires, to fiddle while the world burns. If this is the true nature of the Drow, as the Lolthite priesthood and the Matriarchs of the old regime would have you believe, then the Drow of Tyrranburgh are decidedly unnatural.</span><br/><span class="rvts42">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each citizen of Tyrranburgh holds competition in her heart. Each citizen of Tyrranburgh dreams deceit. Every citizen of Tyrranburgh holds her own goals above all. But Order, rather than Chaos, is the at the center of every goal. The Drow of Tyrranburgh are those that have seen enough of the chaos of their homeland. Those that traveled this far are those that are willing to give Law a try, and have set aside their differences--even just a little bit--in the name of organization.</span><br/><span class="rvts42"></span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts43">Home Territory -- Tyrranburgh</span><br/><span class="rvts44">Aspect 1:&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts45">A Chasm Darkly</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">Tyrranburgh is isolated from the main cavern complex--it was built into a chasm that splintered off from a main route, and its entrances have either been concealed or buried under mounds of rubble. Finding an entrance or identifying Tyrranburgh’s exact location is difficult, and the city’s self-sufficient nature and paranoid inhabitants help keep locals from straying too close.</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">Enhancing this issue is the stark contrast between the decor of Tyrranburgh and the cavern’s external environment. Tyrranburgh proper is designed as a “city within its own little world;” a collection of tall, heavy buildings, carved from blocks of iridescent green stone, and lit by</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">scattered spots of phosphorescent mushrooms. The cavern walls surrounding the city are polished to reflect the city’s lights, and the upper walls and ceiling have been darkened with pitch. When these are combined with the angled spiderweb of streets, and the clammy winds that howl out of the Helviti, they make Tyrranburgh appear like a forgotten settlement on the edge of Tartarus, rather than a thriving city scant feet of rock from the rest of the Underdark.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts44">Aspect 2:&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts45">Caverns Measureless to Man</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">Nestled beneath the Helviti chasm in which Tyrranburgh resides is a large sinkhole complex, dropping into the depths far below. Some of these sinkholes connect with the river that formed the Helviti; when meltwater from the mountains above floods the far end of the chasm, the sinkholes (assisted by Drow trenches and dams) absorb the excess, and channel it into lakes and sunken streams far below. Others, exuding from different points along the chasm, pump out strange smells--of sulfur and rotten eggs; numerous fungal patches grow around these caverns, but said caverns are also host to subterranean carnivores (which of course, only add to their agricultural use). These caverns are some of the only weaknesses in Tyrranburgh’s defenses; they are far too narrow and unstable (and filled with toxic gases) for easy navigation, and thus their exits have proven difficult to block.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts44">Aspect 3:&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts45">Emerald City</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">While not intensely rich in mineral wealth, the Helviti canyon runs through several strong veins of jadeite, a metamorphic rock known for its lustre and ease of carving. It is exceptionally valuable on the surface, but relatively cheap this far below ground, as the lower temperatures and high rock pressure are perfect conditions for its formation. As such, the Drow have made extensive use of it as a building material; its standard light to dark green coloration and mild fluorescence add significantly to Tyrranburgh’s eerie green tinge. Given the variety of colors available, the workmen of Tyrranburgh have essentially begun “color-coding” the city; industrial districts and major roadways make use of darker green stone, business districts use lighter green stone, residential use forest green, and all upper-class buildings make extensive use of the far rarer blue-greens, purples, and near-blacks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">These veins of jadeite appear to coincide with a few weaker veins of titanite (and, as a result, adamantium).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts44">Aspect 4:&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts45">Heavy Metal</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">Extensive excavation has revealed an intricate lattice of raw adamantium ore (what the Dwarves refer to as “Titan’s Blood”) running along the lower segments of the Helviti, in tune with some of the older caverns that trace the chasm. Heavy industrialization has allowed the Drow of Tyrranburgh to construct a small mining complex around the area, exploiting the larger segments of the latticework for industrial and military purposes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">The mines have been claimed by several of the local nobles, including the Jarl herself. As a result, claimjumping is difficult. Unlicensed prospecting and nugget smuggling are both much more common; adamantium chips are now a common and profitable black market trade. This has had something of an “elevating” effect on slaves employed in adamantium mining; the laws set up to protect them as “valuable property” make tracking this behavior difficult.</span></p>
<p class="rvps17"><span class="rvts44">The majority of the adamantium mined goes out to private and public security forces, including the various Goliath units in the Wolfspiders and Caligan guard. Most of the rest goes towards industrial applications, such as construction projects. The remainder can be found in local jewelrymaking, artifice, and civilian weapons manufacturing.</span></p>
