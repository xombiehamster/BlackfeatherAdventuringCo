<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">If you are a halfling, people will expect you to be helpful and cheerful, but with a touch of resentment.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be willing to do odd, thankless jobs, especially those involving cramped spaces.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to act impulsively and thoughtlessly, but to never back down from a goal once you set it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts57"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Although hardly the smallest of all intelligent races of the Mainland Continent, halflings have the distinction of being one of the smallest peoples that will be regularly encountered. Regularly is the key word here; wherever one is likely to find humans, elves, and/or dwarves, one is also likely to find halflings. Fully mature halflings typically stand at around 3 feet tall, and few manage to break 3'6". Typically, they weigh around 30 pounds, although more robust ones can weigh as much as 50 pounds. Because of this diminutive stature, it is unfortunately easy to mistake halflings for juvenile humans, elves, or dwarves; however, one easy tell, even with the absence of normal indicators like defined musculature or full beards (which may not necessarily be a tell thanks to dwarf children), is to examine the skin under their eyes; most halflings bear tell-tale dark circles under their eyes which give the race their distinctive put-upon expression.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Speaking of eyes, halflings have a shockingly wide variety of eye and hair colors, although most of them will be of a darker, less hue of the spectrum; brown, hazel, amber, and forest green are the most common eye colors, with black, brown, dark orange, and a disproportionate amount of blonde being the most common hair colors. A halfling's head, face, and body hair may vary in color; indeed, even the shade of their arm hair and foot hair can vary, making them a veritable rainbow, although typically a drab and muted one. Skin tone varies from willowy to dark brown, with the majority being a nearly chestnut color; however, some halflings may have spots of pigmentation, visually similar to freckles, across their face, chest, and arms which can take a number of subdued colors, such as red ochre, olive green, or navy blue, and even rarely a combination of such.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As can be expected, the specifics of a halflings frame, appearance, and even in some regards their disposition depends heavily on their lineage; while all halflings have somewhere a dwarven ancestor, the other side of their parentage, human or elf, has an impact.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Stout Halflings</span><span class="rvts44">, also known as High halflings, have a more prominent dwarven lineage; these tend to be more robust, more muscular, and more headstrong than other halflings. These are the most common kind of halfling, and as such consider themselves to be the "true" halfling species, with the others being half breeds of half breeds (half-halflings? quarterlings? fingerlings(there are 4 fingers on a halfling hand)?)</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Lightfoot Halflings,</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;also known as City halflings, have a more prominent elven lineage; these to be more lithe, more colorful, and more flighty than other halflings</span><span class="rvts57">.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts71">Ghostwise Halflings</span><span class="rvts57">,&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts44">also known as weirdoes.&nbsp; Most guides hesitate to include this variety, as they are less a distinct group, and more a term used by halflings to describe those who have become... obsessed with something.&nbsp; Speaking on any of those somethings is generally discouraged, but suffice to say given the human tendency towards compulsive obsession, it is assumed that these are more likely of prominent human lineage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts57"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Unlike most other half-breeds, halflings have managed to carve a unique cultural identity for themselves; although these cultural mores are typically restricted to those halflings who were born to other halflings or who were raised by halflings, even those halflings who have human or elven parents tend to find these tenets to resonate with them should they run across them. The first and most fundamental of these is simply that "life isn't fair." This is understandable; while few would say that halflings are without their own advantages or unique skillsets, it is difficult to argue with the fact that their small stature and commensurate loss of physical might gives them a significant disadvantage when compared to races who are larger, stronger, and can reach higher shelves than they can. However, rather than be discouraged by this handicap, halflings believe that this should motivate them to apply themselves fully to every endeavor; while other races may be able to coast by with their size and natural talents, a halfling only has their grit and determination to help them when they're in a pinch. For this reason, many other races believe halflings to be "lucky", as they may witness a halfling on the brink of failure suddenly turn the tide at the last second. Although some halflings resent that this marginalizes their efforts, others encourage this belief, as it's more compelling than the explanation of a last-second burst of adrenaline.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Curiously, one natural advantage which halflings do possess (although not all would describe it as such) is a naturally suppressed fight-or-flight response. Indeed, even magical effects meant to induce terror will often struggle to have the same impact on a halfling as they would on other races. While no biological component has thusfar been identified to explain this phenomenon, halflings themselves have a folksy wisdom about it; They spend their entire lives surrounded by giant people, buildings, and </span><span class="rvts45">food</span><span class="rvts44">. Any halfling who could be easily scared wouldn't live past infancy. Indeed, this lack of fear or anxiety provides a handy explanation for much of the halfling outlook on life; they continually seek success and achievement because it is altogether difficult for them to fear failure. Indeed, halflings are renowned for taking risks and making gambles that most other races would balk at, although this can-do attitude has some significant downsides. Not only do halflings more frequently run into hardship due to what is seen as a general lack of common sense, halflings are also more likely to take risks on criminal endeavors, as they have a muted fear of punishment. For this reason, many halfling sub-cultures have strict prohibitions on activities which can get inexperienced halflings in trouble, such as gambling, cart-driving, and day-trading.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">This suppressed fear response may also help explain the halfling tendency to court with powers that most other intelligent species would run from, possibly while gibbering.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While the vast majority of halfling communities are found embedded inside human, dwarven, or generally metropolitan areas, in some places halflings have banded to make cities or even nations that are predominantly halfling.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Southern Mountains Foothills</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Generally accepted to be the location of the first major halfling populations, the foothills between the Southern Mountains and the Northern Plains mark where paleolithic human communities would have first interacted with mesolithic dwarven communities; fossil evidence from this time plays evidence to these human communities having difficulties when exposed to dwarven-borne diseases, which, adapted to dwarven constitutions, wreaked havoc upon the unsuspecting humans. However, before word of disease forced these early nomads to flee, they left a number of halflings who, bearing some of their dwarven progenitor's hardiness, were able to resist the diseases better. These halflings settled in the rolling foothills in the rain shadow of the Southern Mountains, taking advantage of the mild temperatures and regular rains to develop the foundations of independent halfling culture. To this day, there are a number of small halfling kingdoms and city states that reside in this area, where they clash regularly with the kobold nations of the Dragon Badlands.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Patchquilt Kingdoms</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While it should surprise few that the Patchquilt Kingdoms would play host to halfling nations, it bears mentioning that one of the most successful and long lived of the Patchquilt nations is Konikska, a High halfling dominated Castle Kingdom that has resisted countless invasions by surrounding rival nations. In addition to possessing numerous valuable land-barriers that complicate any offensive march, these halflings have, through careful breeding, managed to take many of the qualities of normally overlarge destriers and other warhorses, and distill it down to a halfling-appropriate package. Although typically halflings are known to be disadvantaged in a stand-up fight, the powerful but nimble mounts, propelling oversized heavy lances, has allowed the Cavaliers of Konikska to take the field time and time again. For this reason, the kingdom is known as a common retreat for any halfling who wishes to reside among their own kind.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Innsmouth Archipelago</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">A chain of rough islands at the mouth of the river Inn, and home to the Dagnostic Hierarchy, the largest predominantly-weirdo halfling nation currently in existence. Despite the official name being "the Dagnostic Republic", the nation is more typically referred to as the Dagnostic Hierarchy, the government / enforced religion of the Republic. The halflings of the Dagnostic Hierarchy are extremely insular and isolationist, and very few outsiders (including other halflings) have ever legally entered the nation's borders; that said, small trading colonies, exiles, and "mission trips" are becoming more common. They're known for their fairly unusual style of dress -- breeches, blouses, and dresses of black or grey cotton and sea silk, in styles that leave little flesh exposed -- as well as their strong religious views, and their reliance on the sea for food, production, livestock, and transportation (in the form of large domesticated crabs, most of which stop at about horse size, but sightings of crabs larger than elephants have been reported in the seas nearby). Warlocks and sorcerers are supposedly quite common within the Hierarchy, though the Arcane University has yet to be allowed in to take a full census.</span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Halflings exist in an odd twilight state as far as adventuring goes; although their lack of fear (and common sense) leads them easily to a lifestyle that promises significant payoffs for ridiculous risks, many of them have difficulty finding a party or company which will hire them on. This is not entirely due to their stature; the abilities of nimble halfling trapfinders and pickpockets makes them an obvious choice for any group delving into ancient labyrinths. The problem is mostly psychological; although obviously not children, many adventurers have difficulty allowing an individual with the appearance and impetuousness of a child into their ranks, no matter how logical they know it is. While some adventuring companies are making strives to overcome this institutional roadblock, halflings themselves approached this resistance with the same determination they bring to other aspects of life; as such, halflings do already have a significant presence in Adventuring, just as henchmen, camp-tenders, cooks and other valuable, non-hazardous (well, mostly non-hazardous; random encounters are everyone's concern) administrative roles. That said, in these more enlightened times, we are seeing greater numbers of martially adept halflings, armed with custom-fitted weapons and armor which allows them to prove their abilities on the frontline.</span></p>
