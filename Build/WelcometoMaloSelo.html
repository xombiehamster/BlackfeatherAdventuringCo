            <h2>Welcome to Malo Selo</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Welcome to Malo Selo, new recruits. &nbsp;I am pleased that you have passed the orientation exams and am glad to have you assigned to Blackfeather's newest field office here on Crnog Otoka. &nbsp;As you will have noticed on the voyage here, we are deep in the heart of the archipelago known as the Elven Isles. &nbsp;As such, it would be wise to take some time while you're settling in to get to know more about the locals.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Our field office here on Crnog Otoka is located at 12 Pero St, in the inland town of Malo Selo. &nbsp;We're about a day's walk inland from the coast here, situated at a crossroads with a very convenient spring. &nbsp;Malo Selo owes its existence to the spring, as it is one of the only naturally occurring consistent sources of fresh water on the island. &nbsp;Due to its otherwise inconvenient location, the town has never grown particularly large.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">To our West and directly uphill, is the larger city, Veliki Grad. &nbsp;Many of your missions may take place in Veliki Grad, so it would be good to take note of some of its more important features. &nbsp;Veliki Grad was built on an active volcano, which has erupted within living (elven) memory. &nbsp;It is an object of much study by the Arcane University, and the city itself has grown from a small research outpost to a metropolitan tourist destination. &nbsp;Mild planar incursions are not infrequent, but are rarely dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">To our South is Luka, the transport hub for Crnog Otoka. &nbsp;It's a reasonably sized port city and unless you were lucky enough to catch a teleport, is probably how you found your way here. &nbsp;If the weather favored it, you may have noticed that you can actually see the next island in the chain from the docks if you looked to the Southeast. &nbsp;That is Bjelokosti, the most densely populated of all the Isles, with only one city on it, Prikrivena Mjesto, the magic city. &nbsp;The bright white line on the summit of its extinct volcano is the tallest Ivory Tower itself, the location of the oldest Arcane University in the world. &nbsp;So old, in fact, that it was considered old while I was alive and is still simply called The Arcane University though others have been added to the University system since then. &nbsp;Luka is an important hub city because Bjelokosti does not have adequate facilities to host its own population as well as their frequent visitors. &nbsp;Being so close, University visitors will instead come to stay in Luka while attending appointments at the University. &nbsp;This is why you will see so much traffic between Crnog Otoka and Bjelokosti.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Northeast and Southeast of our location are two small fishing villages, Riba and Rak. &nbsp;Neither has acceptable terrain to host a commercial port, but both contribute to providing adequate food sources for those living on the island. &nbsp;Combining Riba and Rak's fish and clam catches with the fruit plantations spread sparsely on the island makes Crnog Otoka quite self-sufficient. &nbsp;While you are here, you may enjoy a pescatarian diet while you live in the field office. &nbsp;If your dietary needs have alternate requirements, you will be responsible for making arrangements for import or other sourcing on your own.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Now that you know the lay of the land, there are a few very important rules to get out of the way before I send you on your first missions. &nbsp;We are, quite obviously, in the Elven Isles. &nbsp;Because of this, you must obey Islander law. &nbsp;HQ would not have sent you to me if they did not think you capable of this, but they may have overlooked one small detail. &nbsp;Unlicensed spellcasting is a grave criminal offense here in the Isles. &nbsp;Sorcerers, bards, oracles, this does mean that you will have to apply for and receive your license from the Thaumaturgical Society if you have not done so already. &nbsp;If you are instead a Union member, please keep your documentation on you at all times, as it will only be accepted as a valid license if the arcane marks can be verified in full. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Lycanthropes, you will be required to limit your shifting, as your condition is officially outlawed on Crnog Otoka. &nbsp;Blackfeather is happy to employ you, but you will need to at least pretend to not be capable of shapechanging while working in this area. &nbsp;Pick a form and stick with it, if it's the hybrid we can always claim you're just another odd looking aasimar or tiefling. &nbsp;Our governing laws and the laws on many other islands do not prohibit shapechangers, but this particular isle had problems with weresharks in the past and is not particularly willing to forgive.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Forged and necropolitans, you are not outlawed, but be warned that you are not granted the rights of the living. &nbsp;Here in the Isles as a whole, you will be seen as simple constructs and are treated as property. &nbsp;I have cards I can give you that indicate that Blackfeather is responsible for you and lists your owner's address as this field office. &nbsp;Necropolitans specifically, you are asked to do your best work with your regular taxidermy. &nbsp;Some of the nearby isles do have strict laws against necromancy and if you travel there it may be legal for you to be destroyed on sight. &nbsp;I will personally warn you before assigning you to any mission that would be so dangerous as that, but be aware that as you are not granted living rights you are running the risk of destruction should someone decide that the legal penalty for destroying property is worth their trouble.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Fellow deathless, welcome. &nbsp;Please make yourselves at home. &nbsp;The Walking Ancestors have few worshipers in this region of the isles, but I would not have accepted the long term posting if there were not at least one shrine in the area. &nbsp;Feel free to take some time for your role as Counselors when needed. &nbsp;Additionally, clerics, you do have the same freedom, but I cannot guarantee that there are available temple spaces for worshipers of all divinities. &nbsp;This area is mostly filled with followers of Calestros. &nbsp;On the plus side, this does mean your duties to the Faith will not too often pull you from your duties to the Company.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Welcome again, and please let me know if there's anything you need to help you settle into your new roles here with Blackfeather Adventuring Company. &nbsp;I'm happy to meet you and look forward to building an excellent working relationship over the next years.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Yours,</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts38">Desarai Helene</span></p>
