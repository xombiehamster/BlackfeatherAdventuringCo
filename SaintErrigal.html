            <h2>Saint Errigal</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<h3 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts22">Saint Errigal</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts21">Neutral Good</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">Saint Errgial is not a deity, so to speak, as much as a memory and a belief system. During the Lycan Rebellions, Errigal was a young half-elf oracle. The rebellions were violent and bloody- entire populations were wiped form the earth in violent and personal conflict. Errigal simply sought to soothe the pain the war caused- to anyone. Errigal healed anyone who was wounded- be the elf, halfling, human, or Lycan. If they could not be saved, they were given comfort in death- frequently Errigal gave last rites for any religion. Over time Errigal acquired followers, and started a movement of sorts- healers who walked calmly into the heat of battle to bring comfort to the wounded and dying.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually, Errigal managed to do something unprecedented- an alliance, of sorts, between both the Lycans and the rebels. By negotiating very carefully with the Lycan Lord of the time, Vigamadhr the Bloodied, Errigal gained specific allowances for the battlefield. Errigal's followers were allowed to walk the battlefield, heal the wounded, and provide last rites to the dying. They could do so under two conditions: That Errigal provided healers to combat a currently out-of-control outbreak of filth fever among the Lycans, and that the follower carried no weapons and never participated in combat. In return, no soldier from either side would harm the followers of Errigal so long as they wore their distinctive garb- white robes bearing bright red crosses.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For quite a while, this arrangement stayed. The Followers created neutral healing camps, and eventually numbered in the hundreds. They would take to the field in large groups during pauses in the fighting, and heal or comfort all they could. It lasted until an unfortunate incident.&nbsp;A group of rebel warriors hid themselves among the followers of Saint Errigal, until during a pause for healing they threw off their robes and assaulted a camp full of Lycan wounded, killing hundreds.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; This action enraged the Lycans, and many Lycans were absolutely furious with the followers of Saint Errigal. The Lycan populace demanded blood, and many saw the Followers as having broken their agreement, and thus fair game. Lord Vigamadhr, however, had come to like Errigal and the followers. The following is up for some historical debate- some claim Vigamadhr demanded the following events, others believe Errigal and Vigamadhr came to an agreement before hand. Either way, a price was stated: If Errigal alone submitted to the Lycans and was executed, the rest of the followers would be allowed to survive. Errigal agreed, and was killed in a public ceremony- decapitated, clean and quick. Errigal's followers continued their mission of mercy, and continue to do so to this day.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Errigal is not worshiped as a deity. Instead, Errigal is seen as a Saint- a martyr for a belief system. Followers of Errigal believe in bringing healing and comfort to those in need- regardless of war, race, nationality, religion, alignment, or any number of the wide variety of factors that divide mortals. Followers of Errigal are frequently also followers of other good deities, but the message of Errigal has grown in strength over time so that now divine power can be drawn solely from that ideal.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Followers of Saint Errigal are loosely associated. There is no central church or authority- each individual frequently decides how to practice their faith. Followers of Saint Errigal can be of any nationality or race. They frequently walk the world and heal where they are needed. They are almost universally accepted and liked- they heal anyone and everyone, and as such people tend to like them a lot. Few doors are closed to a Follower, and many establishments will give free room and board on the assumption that they will receive healing. Recently, many prominent Followers have come out stating that the mercy of St. Errigal applies to the peaceful undead- they even heal and provide comfort to the living impaired.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Followers of St. Errigal tend to be pacifists, but this is not a universal rule. The world is dark and dangerous, and many would take even the meager possessions of a travelling healer with violence. Followers of St. Errigal usually only use violence as a last resort, and only kill a sentient creature when there is absolutely no other choice. Monsters do not get the same benefits. Most Followers are uncomfortable around nonsentient undead, seeing them as a violation of Errigal's respectful treatment of the dead. Some destroy them, but most insist on at least perform rites for the body.</span></p>
