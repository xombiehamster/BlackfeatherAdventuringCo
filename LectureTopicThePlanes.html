            <h2>Lecture Topic: The Planes</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">"Good evening everyone.&nbsp; I’m Professor Meritus, from the Arcane University of Thorinsberg.&nbsp; I’ve been asked to speak tonight on a topic with which I have a great deal of experience; namely, The Cosmography of our multi-planar universe.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a complex topic, and I understand many of you have not had any formal training in this subject, so I will attempt to start from a simple foundation and build upon that.&nbsp; We don’t have a lot of time, so let’s get started.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">To begin, let’s start with something that we’re all familiar with:&nbsp; The World.&nbsp; You live on it, you work on it, it’s pretty likely you’ve never left it.&nbsp; It is where most everything you know and cherish resides.&nbsp; And, although you have to share it with literally over 800 Million other people, The World is still large enough that it doesn’t seem to be much of a squeeze. Pretty handy, that. And that’s just by the last conducted census! Between nations that refused to answer, primitive cultures too hostile to investigate, and other mysterious entities like the Tortugatan continent, there could be as many as a Billion... that’s a one, followed by 9 naughts... thinking creatures that inhabit The World.&nbsp; Get used to that kind of scale, by the way:&nbsp; We will be talking about some truly huge numbers in the course of this lecture.&nbsp; Here, I’ll write that one up so we can have a running tally of mind-boggling numerals.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Now, according to advances in Astronomy, a fascinating subject that is sadly not the subject of tonight’s lecture, The World is a “planet”... a sphere which orbits Fernis, our sun, much like our own moon, Luna, orbits us. The World is one of 6 planets in orbit around Fernis, each of which occupies its own orbital boundary and maintains a relative distance from it.&nbsp; Here, I’ll draw a diagram.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">This one closest to Fernis is Terra, then here is Vita, then Aquaan, then here is the World.&nbsp; Out here, we have a pretty significant distance, and then Aeris and lastly Necris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Now, at one point, Cosmographers like myself believed that these stellar bodies were the other planes of existence that are most easily reached by Planar Travel spells, known collectively as the “Inner Planes”: In order of Orbit, starting with Fernis, these would be the Planes of Fire, Earth, Positive Energy, Water, The World... which, in academic circles, is referred to as the “Material” plane... and lastly Air and Negative Energy.&nbsp; However, recent developments in magnification, both mundane and magical, have revealed an astonishing discovery: Given that they lack a number of defining features that can be found on these bodies... In fact, Fernis has been found to be even brighter than the Plane of Fire... it may be, and seems likely, that these bodies are actually other World-like objects, with their own continents, and perhaps even people.&nbsp; We’ll have little chance of checking in person, though: Given the new information available from those advances in magnification, we’ve also been able to refine some of the distances involved in here.&nbsp; While it was previously believed that the closest of these bodies, Luna, was around 10 thousand miles away, it turns out that it could be as much as 200,000 miles away, and far, far larger than anyone previously predicted.&nbsp; And that is a fraction of the distances between us and Aquaan, and that distance is another fraction of the distance between us and Fernis.&nbsp; It has become more and more clear that when talking about other bodies, we are talking about distances of Millions of miles.&nbsp; I’ll give that a moment to sink in while I write that up.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when comparing these derived distances to the observed size and mass of Fernis... that last one being a function of Gravity, but again, that’s another natural science that I would strongly suggest you research independently... it is clear that Fernis is of a mind-boggling size.&nbsp; This size, combined with its overwhelming brightness, and the vast distances that are apparently so common when talking about Celestial Bodies, there are currently some, like myself, that theorize that the stars which one can see at night are actually other bodies like Fernis, just appearing smaller due to great, great, GREAT distance.&nbsp; Now, while difficulties in maintaining thaumic charge outside of The World’s magical sphere has made confirmation difficult, these theories are based off very sound observable principles, and the implications are tremendous:&nbsp; If true, it means that our observable cosm could be quite large indeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Now, I’ve talked a lot so far about planets and moons and suns, when the lecture placard clearly mentions planes. So, how is this relevant to tonight’s lecture?&nbsp; Well, in particular it provides a very simple base point: Our entire observable Cosm, whether it is simply Fernis and its planets or composed of literally thousands of other Fernis-like objects, each with their own planets, any of which could also have other Worlds like our own, with their own continents, kingdoms, people, and lectures, is all one, singular plane: The aforementioned Material.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Hopefully, that sense of hugeness you are experiencing right now will help you understand why even now our understanding of The Planes are still so sketchy.&nbsp; We barely understand the scale and nature of our own Material plane... We still don’t even know if it is finite or not.&nbsp; Goodness, we don’t even know the full extent of The World, much less knowing about the full nature of Aquaan, or Vita, or any of the other Planets, or Luna, or Fernis.&nbsp; There are over nine thousand visible stars in the sky... if each one was like our own Fernis, then the scale of our plane is nearly unimaginable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Even if that particular theory is wrong, and rather than stars, they are planes, that’s still over nine thousand planes that are observable by the naked eye alone, of which we’ve only discovered less than a thousand. Each one of those planes are just as large, if not larger, than our own, and sometimes filled with their own people, places, and histories.&nbsp; Comprehending the scope of the entire Planar Matrix is a daunting task, as some of the numbers involved make this Billion here look like childs play.&nbsp; In just the few planes that we’ve discovered or postulated could exist, it’s possible that there are over a Hundred Billion intelligent beings in our discovered reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">So, now that I’ve blown your mind with the scale of this subject, let’s dial things way, WAY back.&nbsp; What I want you to take away from that segment is to realize that, no matter how much we may currently know about the Cosmography of our reality, there is so, so much we still do not know.&nbsp; In fact, ironically, we may know more about certain planes than we do about our own.&nbsp; What I also want you to realize is that this lecture will by no means make you an expert: each and every one of the subjects I will touch on could be the subject of an entire lifetime of study, and in fact have been, without finding out everything possible about them.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Now with that little taste of what it’s like to be a Cosmographer, let’s get down to brass tacks and actually educate you about some of the basic elements of our known Cosmology.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">First, if any of you actually have some previous experience in Planar Studies, you can probably already tell me the first of the planes to be discovered... The Ethereal.&nbsp; Frequently accessed by many natural... and unnatural... magical beings, the Ethereal is a blurry and indistinct realm that is somehow tied strongly with our own: while on the ethereal plane, although one can move about unhindered and unseen by any obstacles or people on the Material, the plane is nonetheless seemingly bound to The World’s magical sphere... attempts to leave the sphere while in the ethereal have all failed.&nbsp; Furthermore, the plane is not restricted only to the material... Researchers have discovered evidence of the Ethereal plane in both Inner and Outer planes. Given this, there are strong arguments that the Ethereal may not actually be a plane at all, but rather just a coterminous phase of our own reality, but in my opinion, that’s splitting hairs.&nbsp; In any case, the discovery was an important one for Early Arcanists, helping them to understand the concept of another reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;The next stepping stone on the journey to True Cosmography was the discovery of the Astral Plane, and a magnificent discovery it was: A vast, dark reach of nothingness, seemingly empty apart from the presence of our own, Material plane.&nbsp; That darkness was deceiving, however, for the Astral was, in truth, the transit through which all other planes could be accessed directly: Without it, we might not have Planar Travel at all!&nbsp; Rather than functioning like a normal plane, the Astral instead served as a sort of highway through which any discovered plane could be accessed.&nbsp; Now, be forewarned: A common misconception, especially amongst those more versed in Natural sciences than Arcane, is to think of the Astral much like our own Void... that the planes are like planets, and that they could be reached by simply drifting toward them in the Astral.&nbsp; While theoretically true, in practice this is impossible: All attempts to reach planes, even known ones, by mere Astral Drifting have been met with failure.&nbsp; Instead, the greatest strength of the Astral is that it holds the Planar Properties that allow Planar Travel spells to actually work; We will touch on how near the end of the Lecture.&nbsp; However, the discovery of this plane actually allowed Ancient Planar Researchers to construct the spell formulae necessary to actually up and visit many of the planes that, although well known to us, were merely postulated at the time: The powerful and influential Inner Planes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Positive Energy, Negative Energy... these are the traditional foundations of reality, upon which all matter and energy are built.&nbsp; Note that I say “traditional”... Although it has been commonly accepted that these substances are the building blocks from which everything is derived, there are more competing theories emerging in recent years that contest this point.&nbsp; However, they are, again, beyond the scope of this lecture.&nbsp; In any case, the very first True Planar Travel ever conducted was to the planes which personified these basic elements:&nbsp; Even thousands of years ago, ancient wizards were capable of locating and visiting these planes.&nbsp; The reasons are simple:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">One,they are quite simple to conceptualize, which is more important than you might think.&nbsp; This again ties to how planar travel works, so we’ll get to that in a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Two, the principle of creating a temporary bond to these planes in order to enhance spells related to them was one of the first forms of metamagic... forms so common that nowadays, they are incorporated directly into the spells we all use today.&nbsp; Even a spell as simple as your garden variety Fireball would be impossible without this bond... Once those principles were better realized, discovering the source of that power was relatively simple, and could be pinpointed once the basics of planar travel were realized.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;Thirdly, and as an extension of the previous reason, is the astonishing fact that these planes have such a powerful planar influence that many people, even those untrained in Arcanic principles, are capable of forming a bond to them... this is best demonstrated by the behavior of the Positive and Negative planes, which can, and frequently do, form a minor bond with people of the respective emotional outlook. Although it grants no appreciable magical ability, like the aforementioned bonds, it does create a minor bridge that, with the correct Divinations, can be detected... A principle that has, on occasion, been exploited as a means of discerning one’s “Alignment”, as if a person’s feelings and loyalties could be reduced to something so simple.&nbsp; Regardless, the fact that these inner planes can form bonds even with the mun... the Non-magical elements of the population means that, when the first Planar Travellers sought to create Astral Bridges to the source of these phenomena, they found it almost trivially easy to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;Given their importance and ease of access, these 6 planes have been dubbed the “Inner planes”.&nbsp; These are some of the most well known and best researched of all the planes we know of... however, even then, we’ve barely scratched the surface of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike our plane, with its planets and stars, these Inner planes consist almost entirely of their respective elemental makeup;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The plane of Fire is composed entirely of a relentless firestorm...</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The plane of Water is an endless ocean with no surface or floor...&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The plane of Air is a vast sky with no ground or dome of stars above...</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The plane of Earth is a boundless stretch of earth and stone...</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The plane of Positive Energy is a wispy, silvery realm without end...</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">And The plane of Negative Energy is an infinite dark and dismal fog.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">All of them, by any kind of observation, are infinite in size; fortunately for us, all of them appear to be speckled with small islands of civilization and, frequently, life, like the Great City of Brass on the Plane of Fire or the Dark Citadel on the Plane of Negative Energy. More often than not, when one refers to conducting planar travel to an inner plane, their destination will be one of these bubbles of habitability, rather than emerging in the vast expanses.&nbsp; Nevertheless, despite how much more there is to find, we do actually understand a great deal about the Inner planes: they have a predictable nature, sharing a number of our basic thaumic principles, and even a few of our natural ones.&nbsp; For instance, they seem to be in chronological synchronicity with the material plane: in laymans terms, time flows the same there as it does here.&nbsp; So, if you left the material plane and spent a week on the Plane of Earth, and then returned, a week will have passed here as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Having spoken about the Transition planes... the catchall term for the astral and ethereal... and the Inner planes, we now segue into the Outer planes... and here is where things get complicated.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;At one point, it was believed that there were a fixed number of outer planes, much like there were a fixed number of inner.&nbsp; However, as Planar travel grew more refined, this turned out not necessarily to be the case... or, to be more specific, the number of new Outer planes that have been discovered in the last decade alone have given serious question to whether these Planes are finite or infinite in number.&nbsp; Currently, there are over 450 known Outer planes, and more than triple that number that we can calculate should exist and haven’t yet found the formulae to travel to.&nbsp; Both of those numbers grow yearly... each plane we do discover merely opens a whole new series of clues pointing to others.&nbsp; Further complicating this count are recent discoveries in planar granularity:&nbsp; In a recent study, Professor Limpworth of the Arcane University in Federsburro was able to discover an Outer plane similar to the previously discovered Plane of Limbo, yet with a few subtle but distinct differences between the two:&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Astral Bridge she had formed was unstable, and she just barely returned with most of her psyche intact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;Due to this, speaking definitively on the Outer Planes is difficult: Although there are a number of them that we actually can form stable Astral Bridges to, many of these are inhabited by creatures of extreme danger:&nbsp; Conceptually simple and stable, these planes of “Law” or “Evil” or so forth contain creatures that have beliefs and behaviours completely alien to denizens of the Material, and back them up with great and terrible powers. Though the same is true of the Inner planes, these creatures, especially the Elementals, are typically simple forces of nature: although occasionally they can find their way onto our plane unbidden, typically they are a danger simply due to mindless or animalistic rage.&nbsp; However, the most dangerous denizens of the Outer planes are those who are as sapient as you or I, for the moralities of their planes do not mesh with our own; Just because an Archon may come from a plane of “Pure goodness” doesn’t mean they’re safe. These creatures are incompatible with the gray and varied moralities of our plane, and can be as dangerous as any Demon, or even moreso.&nbsp; As such, those outer planes we can easily traverse hold extreme dangers.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are other planes, ones based on less “pure” concepts, that have been discovered, but by and large they are also settled by dangerous and unpredictable creatures and peoples, and even worse may have different Thaumic or Natural principles than our own;&nbsp; if these principles leaked onto our plane, which can happen, the results could be devastating.&nbsp; As such, the research and exploration of outer planes is highly regulated by the Arcane University worldwide, and much of the research restricted.&nbsp; Any responsible Caster would shudder to think of what could happen if an Unscrupulous mage divined the nature of holding open a Planar Gate to a Nether Realm.&nbsp; To this end, I’m afraid there’s not much I can easily divulge to the uninitiated about the specifics of some of the Outer Planes... however, if you make inquiries to your local Councilor regarding your interest in this field, they can authorize you for the appropriate entry-level documents.</span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;The final variety of plane are the Demiplanes, sometimes called “pocketplanes” in common parlance.&nbsp; Though technically Outer Planes, their unique nature requires a separate classification... unlike most planes, they are typically of a small, quantifiable size, possessing only minor native life, if any at all.&nbsp; There are over two thousand documented Demiplanes, many of them seemingly hand-crafted to a given purpose... given their large numbers and unique form, many have postulated that demiplanes, rather than being naturally existing, are actually created by great magics, or being somehow vetted into existence when the a Planar Travel Formula for them is used.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this postulation has rather snowballed in some circles, with some offering some distressingly solid evidence that this behavior may not be limited to Demiplanes, but that even conventional Outer Planes may behave this way.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the aforementioned danger of Planar Travel to Planes with these highly refined planar Formulae has prevented any conclusive evidence to either side... personally, I’d say it’s a little Anthropic to think that the Cosm would be so pliable to our wishes, but I’d just as soon not get involved until more evidence arrives.&nbsp; In any case, Demiplanes are an interesting phenomena, many of them being as stable as the better known Outer Planes with only a fraction of the danger: indeed, some Universities maintain their own permanent connection to a Demiplane for need of a safe testing environment.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;For the final part of my lecture, I’d like to cover some of the basics of Planar Travel, as I promised earlier; now, following the same restrictions as mentioned for the Outer Planes, I cannot give you any specifics regarding advanced astral bridge formulae... which is just as well, as I’m afraid it might be quite impenetrable to anyone not already well versed in their principles.&nbsp; Instead, I’ll cover some of the basic misconceptions regarding planar travel, in order to “Set the record straight”, as it were.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;First and foremost, the basic principle of Astral Travel is that you cannot travel to a plane at random.&nbsp; Each planar bridge you build is unique: although any form of Planar Travel will use the same basic assembly of Thaumic energy, the final projecting formulae involved are unique to each plane.&nbsp; The formulae for the Inner planes are well known and documented, and thus easily reproducible.&nbsp; For Outer planes or Demiplanes, however, the formula can grow rapidly in complexity: indeed, one of the most complex outer planes we’ve currently been able to visit has a formula that takes several days to condensate the arcanic force and had to be written on a single scroll made from an entire elephant hide.&nbsp; Ultimately, this formula must detail the exact Astral “Coordinates” of the plane to function properly:&nbsp; One “degree” off, and the spell might fail, or might deposit you in a similar demiplane, or your Astral Bridge might be wildly unstable, or any number of terrible results.&nbsp; The potential for personal injury and death is tremendous... this is why Cosmographers cannot simply “brute force” the coordinates to try to find planes out of the blue.&nbsp; Instead, it is possible to derive the existence of some planes from the existence of others, and these derivations are then added to what Cosmographers know about the general “shape” of the known Cosm.&nbsp; Only once a formula has been derived for a postulated plane can one begin the arduous process of attempting to focus the formula until it’s accurate, stable, and fit for research. The work is tiring, punishing, and dangerous, but in the end there is nothing more rewarding than making a mark on the “known Cosmap” for a confirmed discovery.&nbsp; I can assure you, it is a rush like no other.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;That concludes the prepared topics I had on hand... Since we’ve got a little time more, I can take some questions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;Yes, you sir?&nbsp; Ah, ah no, they aren’t.&nbsp; Bags of holding and rope tricks and the like are not true planes or even demiplanes, they are “extradimensional spaces.” Essentially, they are places that exist within the Astral plane or, occasionally, the Ethereal or material, which would otherwise be empty space, and thus get utilized for the extra storage.&nbsp; Due to the overlapping nature of the Astral Plane with our own, there’s plenty of space out there that is easily reachable by magic and dashedly difficult to otherwise, so it gets put to that purpose.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn’t worry overmuch about astrally projecting mages stealing your things, though: Noticing an extradimensional bubble within the vastness of the astral would be a most daunting task.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;Yes, ma’am, with the bracelet?&nbsp; Mhm? Ah.&nbsp; Yes. Aha. Very well, although there’s not much to tell. Alright, since it’s been brought up: One of the current debates of our time is the nature of the so called “Plane of Shadow”.&nbsp; Now, many spells, particularly those revolving around illusion, apparently tap into this Plane as though it were an Inner plane, but it also permits travel, much like the Ethereal.&nbsp; Currently, there’s some debate over whether the plane, like the Ethereal, is actually a true plane, or instead just another state of existence tied to areas with strong Magical Presence, or actually is a plane of it’s own accord... this is a common issue with coterminous planes, as their very nature makes it difficult to tell whether they’d function without The World.&nbsp; In any... Yes, sorry?&nbsp; Uh, no, I don’t... well, I suppose.&nbsp; In fairness, I should also mention that there is another theory that’s making the rounds in some circles that the Plane of Shadows is somehow capable of connecting to other Cosms... a theory that there has been, in equal fairness, very little evidence in support of.&nbsp; In any case, you can probably tell that the Plane of Shadow is a hotly contested topic, and so I’d encourage you all to study up on it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;I think we have time for one more question, yes?&nbsp; Yes you, uh... there, yes? Mhm?&nbsp; Ah, now that is an interesting question.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of the Denizens of the Outer Planes, if slain while on the material, do not actually die, but instead return to their plane of origin.&nbsp; However, for whatever reason, we, creatures of the Material plane, do not do the same:&nbsp; As such, exploring outer plains is a good sight more dangerous for us.&nbsp; &nbsp;Current theory is that there is something about the arcanic or natural principles of our Plane that, while common in the rest of the Cosmography, is absent here... dashed bad luck on our part, but oh well.&nbsp; &nbsp;One strong evidence for this is the existence of “Native outsiders”... those born of both of the union of an Outer Plane creature and Material Plane denizen.&nbsp; Though they bear many signs of both heritages, they do not transit to the plane of their Outer parent if slain, nor do they return to the Material if slain elsewhere... it seems that this vulnerability is an inherited trait of Material plane creatures.&nbsp; As for why they have it, and we don’t, we’re still out on that one: Research into the phenomenon continues, however.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;Well, that looks like about all the time I have.&nbsp; Thank you, you’ve been a good audience."</span></p>
