<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts17">&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Leader: The Primarch</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts17">Currency: Permanently Inscribed Gold pieces (common term: PIG or PIGs)</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts17">-------------------------</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts17">National Animal:&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts37">Sus Decapitans</span><span class="rvts17">; Common name: Acid-Mouthed Mammoth Boar</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts17"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The Primarchy is an organized socialist dictatorship consisting of at least fifteen major towns (their government reports eighteen, but outside estimates vary), located on the Northeastern side of Nova Island, between the United Non-Evil Necromantic States to their immediate south and the Second Straibthine Empire to their north. While its government purports to be an open and free society, their geographical isolation and frequent conflicts with the Thaumaturgic Society limit outflow of information, making up-to-date records of their history, population, and situation difficult.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The vast majority of the population of this civilization are Forged, sentient wood-and-metal automata with a strong resemblance to scaled-down iron golems; the rest consists of immigrants from other Nova Island nations, as well as a large population of slaves purchased from the Satrapy far to their south. Reports issued by the government state that these slaves become free citizens immediately after purchase, and are provided free education and jobs in the nation's growing economy. Interviews with local citizens appear to support this, but these interviews are few and far between. Many scholars maintain that such actions are still malignant, regardless of their benign intent.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Prior to the formation of Nova Island, the Primarch, current leader of the Primarchy, is believed to have been constructed by the Archwizard Galbarix as part of a long-term military buildup plan involving the use of high-intelligence automata. After the destruction of Galbarix by an internationally approved adventuring team, and the creation of Nova Island by the backlash of the Archwizard's spell, the Primarch appears to have gathered a tremendous supply of funding from an unknown source (theorized to be Galbarix's old stockpiles), which was then used to purchase a segment of Nova Island, and begin production and development of a number of "Forges" in the new cities built there. These Forges appear to be where new Forged citizens are formed by a process that is currently unknown.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The initial creation of the Primarchy met with a small amount of international hostility. The Thaumaturgical Society was adamantly opposed to its initial creation, as witnessed by the&nbsp;referendums&nbsp;passed through their lobbyists to various Mainland governments, as well as the creation of an Arcane University "bastion" on Nova Island to monitor the newly-formed governments starting their existence there. Their issue appears to stem from the works of Archwizard Galbarix, who was a former member of the Thaumaturgical Society, and engaged in practices diametrically opposed to current Thaumaturgical Society agenda. While the "armies of automata marching on the free peoples of the world" the Society predicted upon the Primarchy's creation have yet to come to pass over the course of the past century of the Primarchy's existence, the Arcane University and its affiliates maintain that the Primarchy requires close monitoring, and have for the most part refused any and all dealings with them.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The Primarchy is known for significant amounts of advanced arcanotechnology, including the development of automated convoy transportation systems called "Trams," which have slowly become popular and recognized among Mainland mining interests. A few of the Free Cities, such as New Highelf, are considering a long-term purchase of Tram technology from the Primarchy, and construction of a New Highelf-to-suburb intrastate tram system appears to already be in production. Other developments and exports include compressed meat products, meat-based liquor products, advanced airvessel dynamics, mass production of ubiquitous magical devices and supplies, and precision machinery and optics.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">As a socialist dictatorship, the citizens of the Primarch have most of their funds, food, and supplies "requisitioned" to them from the Primarchy government, based on perceived need, the decisions of supply management boards, and a small-scale stipend of PIG pieces each citizen receives based on their age, experience, and occupation. The possibility for corruption from this system is obvious, but thusfar, little such activity has been reported--possibly due to the harsh vigilance maintained by their law enforcement agents. Most citizens of the Primarchy experience significant amounts of liberty in their off-work activities, with significant freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of activities legally in place. In practice, the culture at large frowns upon anti-governmental activities; it is worth noting that local law enforcement goes out of its way to prevent the local culture from curtailing the liberties of its citizens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Citizens of the Primarchy have little control over their government at large. While some decisions are made by a national voting system, most large issues are determined by the Primarch and his board of advisors, all of whom hold for-life cabinet positions. The Primarch has mandated "national elections" in the past, supposedly to provide his citizens with the chance to select a new ruler; the "landslide victories" in favor of the Primarch and the decided lack of&nbsp;opposition&nbsp;candidates strongly suggests that these elections are rigged.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">The Primarch's apparent widespread popularity stems from a cult of personality surrounding the leader. Many Forged consider him a god figure--at least partially because of his role in their creation. Worship of the Primarch as a god-figure is now the most common religion in the Primarchy, with Almada worship a distant second. It is unclear whether this worship has spread to outside of the Forged population, but most Forged outside of the Primarchy worship the Primarch, and many human and elven Primarchy residents have been witnessed wearing his symbols. Whether this is out of solidarity, nationalism, actual worship, or external force, is currently unknown.</span></p>
