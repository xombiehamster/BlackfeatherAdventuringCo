By and large, the central holding of the Goblinoid people are those of the Hobgoblin Satrapies, a grouping of small, isolated states within the arid area to the south of the Southern Mountains.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts15">(More to come later)</span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Robust, prideful creatures with a knack for commerce and military strategy. The Hobgoblins of The World are known for their flattering attitudes, their ruthless mercantilism, and their institutionalized slavery.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">If you are a hobgoblin, most people will assume that you're trying to trick them, but would never be rude to them.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">They will assume you to be capable of violence, but that you will rarely use it to protect anyone but yourself unless paid properly.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">They will assume you to be the wealthiest person in the room, but that you will not be easily parted from that wealth.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Hardened by generations of living in the vast sweeps of the Southern Deserts (Which, counter intuitively, also includes some of the most dense jungles in the world, but Cartographical Inertia is a constant factor), hobgoblin physiology has a pronounced ruggedness to it, with many adaptations against hostile environments. Averaging around 5 and a half feet tall and usually weighing around 100 pounds, the best way to describe them in general would be as "wiry", although depending on diet and occupation this shape can vary wildly. Certain hobgoblins, predominantly older or more successful ones, are noted for their tendency towards rotundness, even to the point of apparent morbid obesity; while many assume this to be fat, it is more often retained water, one of their ilk's many adaptations to inhospitable climes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Hobgoblin skin tends towards earth tones, with brown, khaki, and burnt umber being typical; however, one noteworthy skintone, a nearly tangerine orange, is common among devout hobgoblin families, who ritually embalm newborns and children with an oxide solution which permanently dyes their flesh this color. Their hair colors are similar, tending to turn darker as they age; older hobgoblins have almost uniformly black or dark brown hair.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Hobgoblins are renowned for their fastidiousness and attention to appearance, often investing heavily in pigments, ochres, perfumes and hair gels in order to achieve a striking effect. While some, usually younger, hobgoblins will approach this to the point of clothing and cosmetics loud enough to stun a canary, the older and wiser set recognize the deep impact that can be made with simple robes and highlights. Still, when in doubt, it never hurts to drape yourself in gold and silver jewelry. Hobgoblins recognize that you only get one chance to make a first impression, and they intend to leave one deep enough to drink out of.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps23"><a class="rvts36" href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/2297e88d04f00759f6900d092473be77/tumblr_mf95xgF0gh1r1y4kjo1_500.jpg"><br/></a></p>
<p class="rvps23"><a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/2297e88d04f00759f6900d092473be77/tumblr_mf95xgF0gh1r1y4kjo1_500.jpg"><img alt="Hobgoblin" src="lib/NewItem9.png"></a></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">The fastest, and admittedly so reductionist it's inaccurate, way to describe hobgoblin culture is with the phrase "Saving Face". Indeed, Hobgoblin culture places a great deal of emphasis on the concept of public perception among ones peers, betters, and lessers, as a hobgoblin who ignores these social niceties will soon find himself a pariah, unwelcome among even the lowest echelons of hobgoblin society, and even perhaps subjected to an even worse fate: enslavement. As such, most hobgoblins learn from an early age that they must never show weakness, must carefully consider their words, and must always dress to kill... sometimes literally. This cultural conceit of appearances, signalling behaviors, and orchestrated social dances of dominance is often referred to as </span><span class="rvts45">The Game</span><span class="rvts44">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">According to hobgoblins, although they would rarely admit this when around their fellows, the root of The Game comes from a basic understanding of goblinoid motivations; every hobgoblin is, fundamentally, a selfish creature (or at least, believe themselves to be one), concerned first and foremost with their own betterment, even (or sometimes especially) at the expense of others. However, ancient history, trailing all the way back to their origins, has proven time and again that any society founded entirely on individualistic concerns inevitably crumbles into anarchy, which threatens them all. As such, while every hobgoblin cares only about themselves, they must temper this with behavior that makes it </span><span class="rvts45">seem </span><span class="rvts44">as though they are altruistic, in order to "bait" other hobgoblins to work together with them. At the same time, they anticipate that any appearance of altruism from other hobgoblins must also be a facade, but that need not be spoken of as long as all hobgoblins involved keep working together towards a mutual interest. Eventually, one of their number will prove to be a greater manipulator and dealmaker than the others, forcing them into positions of polite submission, where these lessers cannot easily challenge or ignore the word of the better without making their asocial selfishness too readily apparent. As such, you have a great accumulation of selfish individuals who act selflessly to manipulate others into working together, even though all of them know that they are all selfish and cannot be trusted, but they must have the </span><span class="rvts45">appearance</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;of trust so that everyone knows they are willing to play along. At the same time, all of them will be jockeying for position, making open displays of competence, wisdom, or generosity in order to demonstrate their superior skill, minds, or affluence, until their claims of superiority are no longer challenged.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">This atmosphere of universally recognized but unspoken suspicion and betrayal may help to explain why few hobgoblins leave the home unarmed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Levity aside, it is true that the vast bulk of hobgoblins are of a militant mindset; after all, should manipulation fail, force may be expediently applied as a way of achieving one's goals. For this reason, nearly every hobgoblin, regardless of family or status, will dedicate some time to learning the arts of war; in some Satrapies, this is considered an essential part of childhood curriculum, where others will require hobgoblins coming-of-age to spend time in a local militia or similar police force to hone their skills. This cultural focus on proficiency in deadly arts has resulted in a great outpouring of literature and study on their part in regards to the use of weaponry; several of The Worlds most famous Martial Arts were developed and honed in the Satrapies, such as </span><span class="rvts45">Peregrine Freefall</span><span class="rvts44">, the art of overhead striking with an axe or other bladed weapon, or </span><span class="rvts45">The Shield Responds</span><span class="rvts44">, which focuses on how to disrupt or distract one's opponent with a light shield, or </span><span class="rvts45">Mozambique Drill</span><span class="rvts44">, a method for ensuring kills with rapid use of the bow or, for the particularly skilled, crossbow. Masters of this last art have been rumored to be capable of practicing it against the deadliest foes, such as dragons, armed only with ballistae. While this universal skill in military matters has the primary benefit of ensuring that force is an unattractive option for manipulation, as every hobgoblin is capable of defending themselves, it also aids them in one of their kind's most well-known practices; their institutionalized slavery.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">One of the reasons that hobgoblins may dedicate so much of their time to learning and social games is that much of the grunt labor in the Satrapies is performed by slaves. While the Satrapies are far from the only nations to utilize such a practice, few can match their regimented and disciplined approach to how slaves may be taken, how they are used, and how they are best maintained. As with any tool, a slave is best when cleaned, maintained, and used to appropriate purpose; their deep cultural experience has given them countless reams of literature and endless folk wisdom on how to keep slaves healthy, motivated, and docile; counter-intuitively, how well one treats their slaves may be yet another means by which a hobgoblin may signal power and affluence. Indeed, the practice of slavery is so fundamental to their society that they lay claim to entire slave-races, chief among these being the goblins, who serve as housekeepers and garden tenders, although some of the more wealthy families may even invest in slaves or whole slave families prized for their skills as artisans, major-domos, and even tutors. So long have these smaller goblinoids been in thrall to the hobgoblins that only the sparsest records exist of a time before they were enslaved; according to hobgoblin histories, the goblins were little more than beasts when first discovered, and it is only through hobgoblin influence and generosity that they became intelligent and civilized. Also well known are the Haff'Orcs, the hobgoblin's indentured warrior-thralls, whose tribes of trained warriors they deploy whenever serious battle threatens.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">However, goblins are little use for any task requiring significant brawn, such as mining, large-scale farming, and construction, and while Haff'orcs have brawn in spades, they have little patience for performing such onerous tasks when that time could be better spent sparring and readying for conflict. While much, and perhaps even the majority, of such work is performed by free (although not particularly advantaged) hobgoblin families, the difference is made up of a great diaspora of other slaves. The most common of these is the debtor-slave; individuals or even whole families who have defaulted on their payments to wealthier hobgoblins, and are now forced to make up their payments in service to their creditor. In theory, these slaves are only indentured for the length of time it takes to pay their debt, and may be freed(or exchanged) should another seek to pay it; in practice, sometimes the penalties and interest accrued are so severe that only elves or other similarly long-lived races may live to see it paid off. Worse off than these, however, the lowest of the low, are the criminal-slaves, those who were found guilty of heinous crimes such as banditry, piracy, heresy and so forth. These slaves are bound for life, and often are given the most odious or dangerous of tasks, such as tanning, deep vein mining, or camel wrangling.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Given their cultural emphasis on appearances and extravagant displays, as well as their foundation of martial culture, few races are as immediately suited to the adventurer lifestyle as hobgoblins. For some families, time abroad living a life of peril and excitement is a formative experience for a young hobgoblin, as well as a lucrative one; many families have seen their fortunes (in all senses) rising rapidly thanks one of their ilk striking it rich. While these hobgoblins may find solo work or in any number of companies, most frequently they will join one of numerous hobgoblin-centric bands which are infamous (or famous) for serving as a prime source of fresh slaves; they will ride the width and breadth of the mainland continent, seeking brigands, barbarians, and other unwelcome elements, and dragging them back in chains to the markets of the satrapies. Rumors abound of some of these groups sometimes "fudging the numbers" when it comes to who exactly may have done what criminal act, but rarely are they so brazen as to attract the ire of local governments.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">However, one uncommon source are those hobgoblins who have escaped from slavery; curiously, it seems that the hobgoblin's enlightened approach to slavery rarely extends to </span><span class="rvts45">hobgoblin</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;slaves, who will often bear the full brunt of their master's fury or cruelty; while hobgoblin society views those who abuse or mistreat their slaves as crude, impetuous fools, it seems to turn a blind eye when this abuse is piled upon hobgoblins who have failed their societies tests, as all agree it is only their just deserts for having dared to compete when they were so incapable. These hobgoblins, should they manage to flee their captors, will do everything in their power to distance themselves from their kinsmen, and find that their talents in violence and ruthlessness can be a great aid in the field of adventuring.</span></p>

<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts59"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts70">Bughradi</span><span class="rvts62">: Rarely, the secretive Bugbears of the Satrapies may take a Hobgoblin Child as their own, and train it in the ways of their kind. &nbsp;Acting as the link between Bugbears and the Hobgoblin Sultans they serve, these&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts64">Bughradi</span><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;receive a +4 racial bonus to Stealth checks. &nbsp;This replaces Martial Heritage.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts59"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Caravaneers:</span><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;Many Hobgoblins have dedicated their lives to that of the Travelling Merchant, making their fortune from plying their wares. &nbsp;However, they must be ever aware of the dangers of the open roads. &nbsp;They receive a +1 Racial Bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy, and proficiency in a single martial weapon. &nbsp;This replaces Martial Heritage.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts59"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Engineer:&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts62">Hobgoblins, particularly those of the Southern Satrapies, have been exposed to the arts and sciences of the nearby Gnome Kingdom for generations. &nbsp;They receive +2 on Craft(alchemy) and Knowledge (Engineering). This trait replaces Martial Heritage.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Fearsome:</span><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;Many Hobgoblin Satraps, particularly in the Northern Satrapies, have a poorly concealed disdain for the polite societies and soft touch of their Central and Southern neighbors. &nbsp;They rule by the old ways, by Fear and Strength, and their subjects learn to live in kind. &nbsp;They receive +4 racial bonus on Intimidate Checks. &nbsp;This replaces Martial Heritage.</span></p>

<h4 class="rvps13"><a name="TOC-GOBLINS"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts31">GOBLINS</span></span></h4>
<p class="rvps5"><img alt="" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" src="lib/NewItem8.png"><span class="rvts62">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goblins from the Satrapies are a little more civilized. Today, they are a servant class for the Hogoblins. They serve as house servants, accountants, nursemaids, cooks, translators, butlers, and perform any number of middle-range administrative tasks. Goblins rarely perform hard labor. Traditionally, a Goblin servant is seen as a long-term possession of the family. A Goblin family will live with their Hobgoblin masters, and will continue to do so for generations (Though sale of Goblin slaves is not illegal.) Depending on the family they are associated with, Goblins are usually treated relatively well. They frequently have their own smaller quarters attached to a manor. Depending on the wealth of the family, these quarters are usually actually quite comfy.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">&nbsp; &nbsp; Goblins do exist outside the Satrapies. Called "wild" goblins by the empire, these goblins tend to exist at the fringes of society. They tend to be criminals, transients, or even wild tribes. Hobgoblins tend to view these as "lost" goblins, falling into their old "wild" tendencies. They view it as their burden to capture and enslave these goblins to "enlighten" them. They tend to not talk about the fact that their relentless pursuit of these goblins may be why they don't have much of a society. As such, many Goblin slaves are "wild" goblins that have only been captured within one or two generations. These slaves are not generally privy to the familial contracts of their "civilized"&nbsp;brethren.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">&nbsp; &nbsp; Not all nations or city-states allow Hobgoblins to perform slaving activities within their borders. As such, there tend to be wild clans of goblins hiding out in or around these cities. They usually just try to stay out of the way, but sometimes resort to banditry to survive- or because they can't figure out anything else. Most nations are not exactly happy to have these populations around. It brings a lot of undue attention, and cause a problem. They are usually content to pretend these goblins don't exist, but if they become a problem they are "dealt with."</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">&nbsp; &nbsp; An example of goblins outside the Satrapies can be found in the goblin gangs of New Highelf. Since New Highelf does not allow Hobgoblins to take slaves in the city, there is a large population of goblins. Most of them don't have any real education to speak of, and the guards don't really keep track of how many or who they are. Given this, they form gangs to protect themselves, and to scrounge together enough money to survive. They have a reputation for violent crime and thievery, but actual murders are few. They are paranoid, evasive, and frequently confusing to talk to. If you get on their good side, though, you can get a surprising amount of information.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">To quote Dent Grayson, a private detective in the city, "If they like you, they'll probably still try to stab you. It's like saying hello to them. You only have to watch out if they try to stab you twice."</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rumors persist of escaped goblin slaves hiding out with wild goblins, or even in neutral organizations like the Blackfeather Adventuring Company. Hobgoblins vehemently deny these rumors- they very much want to demonstrate that their society improves the lives of goblins. However, those actually familiar with Hobgoblin society know that escaped goblin slaves are usually treated as serious criminals- often put to the sword with little to no questions asked.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62">Since they are a little more civilized (usually) in this setting, here are some alternative racial traits- [[THIS IS ROUGH]]</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Civilized-</span><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;This Goblin was born and educated in an advanced society. They do not have the tribal origins of their species, and the focus of their life is very different that Goblins of the past. Their ability scores are -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, and +2 Intelligence. They begin speaking Common as well as goblin, can learn any language as a bonus language, and receive an extra language every time they put a rank in linguistics. This replaces the standard Goblin ability score block. This can be taken with other alternative racial traits.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Underclass-</span><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;You are used to operating underfoot and unseen by your "Betters" and can use that to your advantage to find out things they don't want you to know. You gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy to gather information, and&nbsp;on all Bluff checks to avert suspicion, avoid punishment, or seem harmless.. Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (Nobility) are always class for you, and if you take a class that makes them class skills, you gain an additional +2 bonus. They gain a +2 bonus to stealth in crowded areas. This replaces Skilled.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Majordomo-&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts62">You were or are a trusted servant for a wealthy or influential Hobgoblin family. You are used to rubbing elbows with the upper crust, have seen just about every race on the planet, and can talk a serpente under the table. You gain a +3 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy, and can shift an attitude up 3 levels instead of two. They gain a +2 on linguistics, linguistics is always class, and they gain an additional language every time they put a rank in linguistics (Which stacks with civilized.) In addition, once per day, they can roll twice on Bluff or Diplomacy and take the better result. This replaces Skilled.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts62"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts61">Dissenter-</span><span class="rvts62">&nbsp;This goblin is not happy with their station. Whether they are overt about their beliefs (in which case they are a wanted criminal) or not, they hate the role that has been forced upon them and yearn for freedom. Free or not, they do whatever they can to throw a wrench in the plans of their "Masters," or anyone else that tries to keep goblins down. They gain a +2 Bonus on Stealth, Disable Device, and Disguise. They gain a +4 bonus on bluff when lying to someone higher up on the social ladder (which is most people.) Those skills are always class for them.</span></p>
