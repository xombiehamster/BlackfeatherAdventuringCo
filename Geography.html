            <h2>Geography</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts13">There are five major cities in the UNENS: Two Rivers, Woodville, North Watch, Mine City, and Contingency. &nbsp;There are also at this point many small outlying villages, but the majority of the population still is contained in the major cities. &nbsp;These cities are very well built up and metropolitan in culture and building style.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts21">Two Rivers</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;is the colony's capitol. &nbsp;It is well known for its exports of fine linen, art, luxury goods, literature, and theater. &nbsp;The architectural style tends to be elaborate, blending elements of the Gothic cathedral building style with elements of art deco design. &nbsp;Much of the city was built of solid stone, moved into place by living-impaired automatons and shaped by highly skilled artisans in the dead of night. &nbsp;Many residences have no windows, and those that do tend toward heavily tinted colored glass. &nbsp;The city's own cathedral to Hekahuh hosts the capital guard unit of animate gargoyles.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts21">Woodville</span><span class="rvts13">, the second largest of the cities in the UNENS is characterized primarily by its large elven population. &nbsp;This city's exports include the highly prized bronzewood of its local forests, which are tended to by a contingent of deathless druids. &nbsp;The city has become a cultural hub of the cult of elven ancestor worship centered around the Undying Court. &nbsp;The temple complex in this city is a temple in the honor of these ancient unliving ancestors, and it hosts an unusually large number of deathless.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts21">North Watch</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;grew from being a small outpost marked by its status as the closest town to the northern border with the not-precisely-hostile Second Sabratine Empire. &nbsp;This is where the military training centers are located, and where the dead from any conflicts involving the UNENS are brought to be animated toward the noble purpose of defending the State. &nbsp;From this beginnings an industrial city has grown. &nbsp;Their major exports are the non-tangible good of military training, skilled tutors, and the more tangible goods of finely honed arms and undead steeds.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts21">Mine City</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;is also an industrial town, seated directly to the north of Two Rivers, between North Watch and Woodville. &nbsp;This city is named horribly unimaginatively, as it is the home to the dragonsteel mines where North Watch gets their raw materials. &nbsp;The city is generally middle class in population, and is mostly home to Union members and their families who manage the living-impaired automatons who actually labor in the mines. &nbsp;It is a less sophisticated town compared to Two Rivers, but no less comfortable in terms of average comfort level of the individuals who inhabit the town. &nbsp;There are many very pleasant crypts and the second largest export of this city, right after metal ore, are their famous carved stone sarcophagi.</span></p>
<p class="rvps11"><span class="rvts21">Contingency</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;is unique among most cities. &nbsp;The city itself and its population for the most part have remained nigh completely unchanged over the past century. &nbsp;This city was founded as a shelter for a township from the mainland whose entire population was instantly turned into necropolitans in a natural disaster. &nbsp;Their neighboring towns shunned them, so they were exiled to the UNENS. &nbsp;These people mostly wanted to just continue as they had been before the disaster, and so did not fit in with Two Rivers society. &nbsp;To&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;this population, and to assure the continuation of the social experiment should the Second Sabratine Empire out of their ancient bias decide to eliminate the necromancers, the town of Contingency was founded. &nbsp;Contingency has remained mostly unchanged in the passing time. &nbsp;It is the only town in the UNENS with an entirely living-impaired population. &nbsp;It has grown somewhat over time, with older necropolitans moving there when they decide to abandon the living completely and embrace a society that completely embraces their unlifestyle choices, and unwillingly created necropolitans moving there to find a sense of normalcy away from the death-centered social structures of the rest of the UNENS. &nbsp;It is a very strange place, which does not really have any major exports to speak of as they do still maintain a pretense of secrecy by routing all of their business through the capitol.</span></p>
