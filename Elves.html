<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Graceful, lithe, long-lived creatures who have speciated into dozens of different breeds. The Elves of The World are known for their unpredictable behavior, their aloof attitudes, and their complex web of intra-family politics.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">If you are an elf, most folks will expect you to be fickle and unpredictable, but wise and knowledgeable about any subject.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be stand-offish and condescending, but that those who catch your attention will benefit from your connections and personal wealth.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect that you are out of touch with normal people, but that somehow simultaneously that you are on top of every situation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts57"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Giving a definitive description of Elvish Physiology is complicated by the expansive number of Elven Breeds in play; between all of them, Elven skin tone can range from pure marble white to deep onyx black, with numerous stops on the color spectrum along the way. Furthermore, Elven hair and eye pigments incorporate forms of melanin not otherwise seen in nature, allowing them not only to be of a garish assortment of colors, but also to take on different reflective aspects, allowing their hair to be matte, glossy, or metallic. Structurally, most Elvish Breeds tend to be slightly shorter than the average humanoid, and possess little in the way of body fat, usually weighing around 100 pounds.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While the Elvish breeds may vary wildly in these particulars, there are a few traits that are shared among all of Elvenkind. All Elves possess pointed ears which lends them acute auditory perception(and any number of lazy epithets), angular facial features, and four fingers to each hand. Additionally, all elves possess an innate connection to The World's thaumic field which allows them to partially sustain themselves with magic; through instinctual meditation, Elves are capable of eschewing sleep, a fact that makes them resistant to common forms of somnothurgy and other similar enchantments. It is theorized that this magical maintenance is in part responsible for the Elves most noticeable shared trait; extreme longevity. Elves have been known to live as long as 1500 years naturally, although their average life expectancy is closer to 700 years.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">It is further theorized that this Longevity may have played a role in the vast number of Elven Breeds in existence; as Elves reach physical maturity at around the same age as other humanoid races(although adulthood is a different idea, see below), it would have been possible for dedicated Dynast of an Elven family to carefully control the outcome of numerous Elven generations; however, as no historical record of any such programs exists in the modern day, most Elves consider this theory to be slanderous. That said, the fact of the matter is that Elves organize themselves into dozens of different breeds; as a comprehensive list would be more confounding than helpful, these have been grouped together into several rough categories for your convenience:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">High Elves</span><span class="rvts44">: Also known as Islander Elves, Native Elves, just plain ol Elves, Tower Elves, and Pompous Gits, High Elves are those Elves which are either native to or directly descended from the families of the Metropolitan centers of the Elven Isles, such as Arcanis or True Highelf. These elves are taught to harness thaumic energies from a young age, often manifesting as rudimentary spells. Curiously, this practice of regular thaumic consumption often leads to permanent glowing in the sclera.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Sea Elves</span><span class="rvts44">: Also known as Atoll Elves, Archipelago Elves, Frigate Elves, River Elves, Lake Elves... you get the picture. Elves are considered the first race to become truly Oceanfaring, in part thanks to the natural aquatic talents of Sea Elves. Possessing skin, hair, and eye colors that incorporate blues and greens more frequently than other Elves, Sea Elves have a preternatural sense for ocean currents, a deep rooted understanding of sea fauna, and webbed digits. In spite of the natural magical dampening properties of the Oceans, Sea Elves have little trouble achieving meditation while at sea, unlike most other Elves for whom the voyage is largely uncomfortable.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Wood Elves:</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;Also known as Plains Elves, Brush Elves, Desert Elves and so on, depending on their particular environs, these are Elves who have maintained a deeper cultural connection to the wilds. Found in scattered settlements across the Elven Archipelago and parts of the mainland continent, these Elves sport complexions and colors that allow them to blend in with their associated terrain. Curiously, this ability to blend in with natural terrain seems to extend to biomes other than their native ones.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Mainland Elves: </span><span class="rvts44">Also known as Eladrin("outsider") Elves, City Elves, Thems Elves, and by the epithet Mongrelves, these Elves are the ones that an adventurer is most likely to encounter; Descended from numerous Islander Elves who opted to stay on the Mainland Continent after discovering it, they lack the same distinction that most other Elves put on their particular lineage, usually viewing themselves more as citizens of whatever municipality they grow up in. As most Mainland Elves lack the regimented instruction in harnessing thaumic energies that other elves do, their powers are a bit more unfocused, but can manifest themselves in flexible ways.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Drow</span><span class="rvts44">: Sometimes known as Dark Elves, but most frequently just plainly as Drow, these are the offshoot of an branch of Elvenkind which migrated to the Mainland continent long before it was "discovered" by other Islander Elf cultures; however, as their ranges were largely restricted to the Glacial Caverns of the Northeast Glacial Sheets, few knew about these Elves until relatively recently. They are know for their dark complexion, keen underground eyesight, and a capriciousness that puts even other elves on edge.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Much like their physiology, making any definitive statements about Elven Society is difficult; each Breed and Sub-breed of Elf has their own specific variations on traditional virtues, vices, taboos, and more. Further complicating this is the one thing that tends to be a universal feature: The Elven concept of Family. Similar to human concepts, Elves tend to think of their Loyalties less in terms of Nations or Cities, and more in the form of their particular genetic lineage; this familial loyalty is reinforced by the fact that the most powerful and influential members of a Family, known as </span><span class="rvts45">Dynasts</span><span class="rvts44">, typically wield major influence in whatever government or municipality the elf may find themselves in, and as such their loyalty to their family has more immediate, tangible benefits than loyalty to King or Country. As such, since a young elf must learn to internalize not only the cultural requirements of their Race, their Breed, their Family, their Geographical region, and on top of all that the cultural demands of whatever particular municipality they occupy, it is little wonder that most Elven Cultures don't consider a young Elf to be a full adult before they've had roughly a century to learn how to avoid all the foils, social pitfalls, and faux-pas they could commit. Unsurprisingly, many young Elves balk at this treatment, acting out against the social traditions which marginalize them; this is also recognized as part of the maturation process, and most Elves grow out of it, later coming to deeply regret their youthful outrages and recognizing how what they thought was rebellious and admirable was actually petulant and childish. The Elven term for these individuals who are between physical and mental maturation roughly translates to "Between-Agers".</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts58"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">A logical consequence of this decades-long learning period for acquiring social graces is that Elves tend to have a dim outlook on most other humanoid species, in large part because their declarations of adulthood and wisdom and their early ages of 30 or 50 serve as an embarrassing reminder to most Adult Elves of their own youthful delusions of grandeur. This often results in Elves coming off as aloof or condescending to other races, and it is only through regular exposure that an Elf can learn to moderate this instinct. Further complicating this is the perspective from the other side: To most Non-Elves, Elven traditions are labyrinthine, draconian, and, with fair frequency, entirely insane, with beliefs and assertions that stand in total opposition to easily observed reality. The fact that these beliefs are the result of Millennia of polite understanding and compromise between families means little to Non-Elves.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">However, in spite of their longevity, Elves are no more immune to boredom than any other race. Indeed, their long lifespans actually may be the source of the Elven stereotype for capricious, fickle behavior, as they rarely have to contend with the "sunk cost" concerns of other races. An Elf who has spent the last twenty years of life becoming a skilled wood carver feels no hesitation should they then decide to try their hand at being an investigative reporter; after all, what do they really lose? A few measly decades?</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Elven Isles &amp; Elven Archipelago</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Commonly understood the be the birthplace of the Elven Race, the Elven Isles and Archipelago rest well off the shores of the Mainland Archipelago, their location somewhat obscured in earlier ages by a persistent weather pattern that causes a hazy gray mist to envelop much of the surrounding ocean.&nbsp; This mist, known creatively as "The Elfmist", was responsible for isolating the bulk of the Elven population from interacting with the rest of The World for thousands of years.&nbsp; It was only with the development of sophisticated naval technology, like "sails" and "compasses", that Elven Expeditionaires were able to sail beyond the Elfmist and discover Mainland Continent. This discovery allowed them to share their advanced understanding of Thaumic Principles, which, when combined with the numerous new reagents and raw materials available on the Mainland Continent, led to the massive, breakneck accumulation of arcane knowledge and power that culminated in the event now known as the Wizard Wars.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many consequences of these wars was that the Elfmist is now a mere shadow of it's former self; While it was still sufficiently dense to confound Mainlander Navigation for several more centuries, nowadays knowledge of the sea lanes&nbsp;and currents which will take enterprising individuals into the Elven Isles is a poorly kept secret, much to the chagrin of more isolationist Elven societies.</span></p>
<p class="rvps27"><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/manifestdestinysetting/adventurer-s-travel-guide/raceguide/common_races/elves/ElvenIles.png?attredirects=0"><img width="300" height="320" alt="" src="lib/NewItem7.png"></a></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Though typically just called the Elven Isles, the Elven Isles and Archipelago are, according to Elven Tradition, actually two entirely different concepts that happen to exist in the same general area.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The Elven Isles specifically refers to the largest landmasses in the general area of the Elven Isles, which are known to be the traditional holdings of the greatest Elven Empires:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Azure Lands Empire, known for their monopoly on a form of magic-retaining crystal which only grows on their Island.&nbsp; One of the most efficient forms of Arcane Batteries currently known, this natural resource gave them a significant edge in sailing upon the normally magic-deadened&nbsp;oceans of The World.&nbsp; In spite of this edge, however, the Families of the Azure Lands are notoriously Isolationist, and are known to use their sailing prowess predominantly to deny access to the Elven Isles to any who are not native to the Elven Isles.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The Grove of Cypress, who are renowned for their cultivation of Natural and Druidic magics.&nbsp; They are singularly responsible for the common Elven Stereotype of being tree/nature obsessed, as their mastery of Arbormancy allowed their Families to rapidly colonize numerous forested regions of the Mainland Continent.&nbsp; &nbsp;While many of these Families ironically "went native" after being cut off during the Wizard War, many of them continue to operate in Circles which are still loyal to the Grove.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Old Highelf, which holds the rather impressive claim of being one of the first societies on The World to be able to wield the High Arcanas.&nbsp; In spite of this impressive pedigree, many consider Old Highelf to be an empire in rapid decline, as their Families have largely withdrawn from greater Elven society.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">In contrast, the Elven Archipelago refers to all of the smaller landmasses in the area, upon which a vast multitude of different nations, cultures, and subspecies thrive.&nbsp; It is theorized that these isolated communities are responsible for much of the Speciation that occurs among Elves, as the Families in these isolated communities became adapted to their particular environs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">It should be no surprise that, as with most races, the Adventuring spirit happens most often in Elven Youths. Whether frustrated with their marginalization, hoping to improve their standing in their Family, or just indulging a whim to suffer slings and arrows for the promise of outrageous fortunes, Elven Adventurers are well regarded for the skill and natural talents that they can bring to the table. Although many find themselves plying their Race's natural talents for the Arcane, there are also plenty of Elves who are ready to demonstrate the Decades of practice that they have put into numerous Elven Martial Styles. That said, new Elven Adventurers may find that it takes their companions a while to warm up to them; the Elven reputation for hubris and flightiness makes many wary, and not without reason. Those Elves who learn to temper their frustration with the other races, however, often prove themselves to be capable allies, and those Elves who manage to earn a name for themselves in the Adventuring ranks can find their services in great demand for decades to come... provided they avoid the numerous occupational hazards along the way, of course.</span></p>

<h2 class="rvps28"><a name="TOC-TL-DR"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts65">TL;DR</span></span></h2>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13">There exist many multitudes of differing varieties of elves. &nbsp;They do all share a few traits in common: pointy ears, four fingers to each hand, exceptionally long lives, and a specific understanding of the supreme importance of family.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13">The patron deity of all Elvenkind is Calestros, but they are also known to frequently worship Lolth, Lawlth, or the somewhat heretical Walking Ancestors.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13">Elven nations can be found on nearly all parts of the world. &nbsp;There are elves in the underlands, elves on the mainland, elves out in the ocean, plus a whole nation of elves on islands out in the ocean. &nbsp;There are dark elves, drow, gray elves, wood elves, pale elves, tower elves, savage elves, arctic elves, dusk elves, dead elves, and even winged elves. &nbsp;Half-elves are not uncommon, and while the other half can be just about anything with Bronix's intervention, it's most common to find half-human half-elves.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13">While most of the world sees elves as a subtype of humanoid, many elves instead view human as a subtype of elven and all the world is made up of dilutions of the pure elven form. &nbsp;This is not usually spoken aloud in polite conversation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts13">There are so many elven subtypes that we've only written a few entries on specific elven types.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">This is hardly an exhaustive list. &nbsp;Furthermore, elves can be found nearly everywhere and new, previously unheard of varieties are still being discovered to this day.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<h4 class="rvps12"><a name="TOC-A-SMALL-NOTE-ON-AGE"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts30">A Small Note on Age</span></span></h4>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">It has been determined that the official elf age tables make no sense at all, with adulthood lasting only 75 years and venerable lasting anywhere between 4 and 400.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such from now on, elves enter adulthood at 110, middle age a 300, old at 450, and enter venerable at 550 with 2d100 years before the end of their lifespan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
