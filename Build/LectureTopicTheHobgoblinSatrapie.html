<td valign="top" style="padding: 10px;"><p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Good evening, Class. Today, I’d like to take a diversion from last week’s discussion in order to educate you on a World Power that started coming into prominence around that time, and which has an impact on The World even to today: Namely, the Goblinoid nations. Now, going into depth on the rise and fall of the Hobgoblin Empire and the formation of the Satrapies would require a class all its own, and, in fact, one that I will be teaching next Semester, if you’re interested, but for today we’ll stick to the basics.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, although I’m certain you’re all familiar with the common races of the Satrapies, here’s a quick refresher:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">Hobgoblins, the culturally dominant species(etymology funfact: The “Hob” in hobgoblin means “High” or “Master”).</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">Goblins, the diminutive servants of the Hobgoblins, most often seen as house slaves or groundskeepers.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">Bugbears, about whom very little is known, due to purposeful obfuscation on their part.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">And Orcs, the Warrior-Slaves of the Hobgoblin Sultans, who won’t be featured in this period, as they were integrated after the time we’re talking about.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With that in mind, lets take a quick look at the modern day: Although small holdings, colonies, and enterprises exist throughout the Mainland, the vast majority of Hobgoblin territory is here, in the hot, arid area just south of the Southern mountains. Although it may seem quite large at first, especially compared to the holdings of the City-States, one must realize that the vast majority of this is completely uninhabited, and, in fact, quite hostile to life. As such, most of their population centers occupy the small pockets of habitability available in this harsh environment, including the numerous rivers, lakes, and oases that form within this area. Within these pockets, nearly a hundred Satrapies polkadot the map. These Satrapies are roughly grouped into 3 political blocs that dominate the territory...</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">The Northern Satrapies, dominated by Shah Mugharet...</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">The Central Satrapies, dominated by Khaliph A’Khelefret...&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">And the Southern Satrapies, dominated by Sultan Khaless, although in practice the vast majority of day-to-day decisions are actually made by a group of trusted advisors, known as the Oligarchic Council.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All of these political ranks may be as confusing to you as terms like Duke, Lord, And King might be to them. Unfortunately, there aren’t perfect translations for these positions of power, especially since they aren’t codified ranks per se, but since we’re keeping it simple here, here are some handy rules of thumb;</span><br/><span class="rvts18">At the bottom is a Satrap, which is equivalent of a Mayor or Baron. Though the lowest political rank, they hold significant clout in their Satrap (yes, they reuse the term to mean both the ruler and the territory) due to the somewhat isolated nature of many Hobgoblin settlements. In general, they will exercise control over a single settlement. Although control of a Satrap is frequently passed down to family members, this is not always the case as it is more a concern of political and financial clout than any kind of traditional rule.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next up, roughly, is a Sultan, but the term is a very freewheeling one, being equivalent to a Duke, Count, or even King. A Sultan is mostly defined by family wealth and a history of rule, and so the actual territory held by a Sultan may vary widely: While one Sultan may hold dozens of Satraps under the Family Banner, another may hold only one Satrap of significant value. Unlike Satraps, the rule of a Sultan is a traditional one, to be passed down to an heir upon the death of the current Sultan. And, for the most part, as long as they maintain their wealth, clout, and control, these dynasties remain mostly stable. Often, Sultan families have a stranglehold over some local good or precious trade that helps to ensure their continued wealth.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From here, the waters become even more muddy and are heavily involved with ancient history. Since understanding the significance of these titles is difficult without a bit of background, it makes sense at this point to move onto the origins and ancient history of the Hobgoblins. Now, once again, we’re trying to keep things simple, so you’re going to get the highly compressed version, so those of you already familiar with the Long and Storied history of the Goblinoid people may notice a couple of skipped details.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, in spite of their current habitat, the physiology and sensory glands of modern hobgoblins make it clear that they had a subterranean origin: Indeed, there is considerable evidence, including Dwarven cave carvings, that the Hobgoblins and the Dwarves had a shared homeland in the Southern Mountain Ranges. However, these historical records also make it clear that the two shared a bitter enmity. However, about 16,000 years ago, it seems that the development of certain new weapons by the Dwarven tribes spelled doom for the neighboring Hobgoblins, driving them from hunting spots and camping grounds. Within two thousand years of developing this weapon, the Southern Dwarves completely exterminated all mountain-dwelling hobgoblins.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to ancient lore, the Hobgoblins of the Deserts owe the survival of their species to an arduous migration that they call Tuhleu Auenehr, “The Trail of Fire”. This trek has significant cultural, spiritual, and historical relevance to the Goblinoid people, although much of what has been written on it is largely apocryphal. However, the important gist of it is that, during the Dwarven Massacre, as they refer to it, a significant number of Hobgoblin tribes ventured forth from their native homes in the mountains, following the flow of the Nahrah River, the banks of which had swelled significantly as a large amount of mountain ice had begun to melt as world temperatures warmed. Following the tributaries and distributaries of the Nahrah, these migratory populations became widely distributed, and, as the banks returned to normal size, were forced to find more sustainable oases, rivers, or coasts to live on, and it’s likely that a significant part of the population became stranded in inhospitable deserts. However, the population as a whole managed to eke out a more sedentary existence in this otherwise hostile environment.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Flash forward by about 8,000 years. The many migratory tribes of Hobgoblins became more and more sedentary as River flows dried and oases shrank over thousands of years. However, the rise of primitive subsistence agriculture, including simple irrigation, helped these small communities cling to life, and so all across the Southern deserts small settlements As the temperature of the world stabilized and river flows normalized, one particular area of the Deserts continued to enjoy fairly significant flows, and the migratory animal populations that came with them. The Wahedah Valley, a deep ravine formed by the Cabir River, remained as fertile and bountiful as it had in centuries past, and as time went on, became the site of the first grand settlement of Hobgoblin Antiquity; The Ancient City of Kheleko.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kheleko was the first true “nation” of the Hobgoblin people: Although the nature of its original government is largely lost to time, it would be considered the seat of rule for the Hobgoblin people for nearly 4000 years, although it would pass through many hands during that time. The best known of these rules would be that of the Sulumein Dynasty, a family of Hobgoblin Emperors that introduced many of the modern features of the Satrapies. Beginning around 5,000 years ago, the Sulumein Empire is marked by a period of rapid expansion and conquest of the tribes and villages in the areas surrounding the Wahedah valley, utilizing a brand new superweapon... The Chariot. Equipped with this brand new weapon, along with the rise of Copper and Bronze weapons, the Empire grew to absorb the most prominent settlements and tribes of the Central Deserts in only about 300 years. The spoils and slaves from these conquests helped Kheleko grow significantly.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is during this period that many of the Modern Satrapies and Sultanates have their origin, although few resemble their original form today. The Emperors of the Sulumein Dynasty appointed many “Shahs”, or Warlords, to help them extend their conquest, and who would continue to rule those areas as long as they paid tribute back to Kheleko. In turn, the Shahs would further divide their territories to Sultans, and those Sultans to Satraps, forming an orderly divide of rule which allowed for a degree of autonomy necessary for holds that were so widely isolated. Today, only one Ruler, Mugharet, retains the Title of Shah, the traditions of which her family has kept alive for thousands of years. Reportedly, they still wait for the day that a “True Emperor” shall return to rule the Satrapies. But I digress.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to Khelefret Religious texts, it was around 4,600 years ago that the Emperor of that time, known only as “The Khel”, received a vision from Khelefret. It revealed that the southern deserts, a particularly inhospitable band of sand and not much else, had concealed a fertile new land for the Hobgoblin people, and one only had to brave the sands to conquer their spoils. It is said then that the Khel collected a force of “20,000” Chariots... a most unlikely number... and set across the sands. As is to be expected, much of the force was lost attempting to cross this inhospitable terrain, but ultimately, they did make it to the other side, which, if you’ve been paying attention to your Geography lessons, you would know as the Khel Plains. And what they found there was that they were not the only Goblinoids in The World... nor the only Nation.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Khel Plain played host to numerous primitive tribes of Goblins, most of whom eked out a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the rich plains of the Khel. However, in the century leading up to the arrival of the Hobgoblins, their habitat had become threatened by Gnomes who were expanding into the area. Though only a paltry military presence, they were more than sufficient to overwhelm the divided and unorganized goblins. With the arrival of the Hobgoblins, however, they faced a foe that was geared for conquest and had every intention of doing so. While the entirety of the conflict could hardly be called a war, as it more consisted of regular raids and aggressive pushes over several decades, it ultimately lead to the more-or-less still established border between Hobgoblin and Gnome that we see today, ultimately solidified by the construction of the Grand Wall between the two. Meanwhile, the Goblins, as mystified by these newcomers as they had been of the Gnomes, found themselves brought back to Hobgoblin Civilization as slaves, a position they still are in today... It is often written as part of ancient contracts that this is only fair, as it was Hobgoblin wheels and spears that saved them from extinction at Gnomish hands.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the Sulumein Dynasty ended around 4,300 years ago, other Dynasties would rise and fall over the next 600 years, but few could reach the same heights of influence that the Sulumeins could. This general weakening of the Emperor would, ultimately, lead to the fall of the Empire. The Fall begins around 3,900 years ago, when the Tukayiid Dynasty, which had conducted numerous failed military campaigns against both Dwarves and Gnomes, end with Khel Vargens. He is succeeded by his cousin, Byblos, an incompetent, a fool, and a madman: His blatant cronyism helped fill the coffers of a select few, while his erratic and often violent behavior against his advisors, Shahs, and even Clerics of Khelefret made an already bad situation worse. Unrest grew throughout the Empire, as the holdings of the Shahs loyal to him grew while those of other Shahs faltered. The final straw was an event now known as the Martyrdom of Khosp, in which Khosp, a cleric and son of the current High Cleric (Khaliph), went to the Khel to petition on behalf of the offended Shahs: during the proclamation, the Khel became so enraged that he lifted Khosp bodily and hurled him down the stairs to his palace. The fall killed Khosp.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The offended Shahs saw this as proof that nothing would be solved by words alone, and instead took up arms against the Khel: Even some of those who had originally profited from him found themselves unable to tolerate what he had just done. However, the Shahs of the North, which had always prided themselves on a history of undying loyalty (necessary, as they were the sole protectors of the Empire from their ancient foes, the Dwarves), moved against these Rebels. Meanwhile, the Khaliph, grieving the loss of her son, made impassioned speeches to the common people of the Empire, leading them to take up arms against what had become “an ignorant and self-destructive Throne”.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The details of this conflict are many, and well chronicled, but again outside of the scope of this lecture. Instead, lets move to the ultimate outcome: The Rebel Shahs were, by and large, crushed not only by the loyal Shahs, but also by their own people, as the word of the Khaliph spread throughout the Empire. The Loyal Shahs, however, did not get off lightly: The central and southern Shahs were caught in the middle of the Rebellion, and many of them were crushed before help from the north could arrive. The Khel himself was found dead within his chambers... the true cause of his death is still unknown. However, he left no successors to follow him. Into this Vacuum stepped the Khaliph, who, helped by popular support, was able to assume control easily. However, rather than taking the mantle of Khel, as others had before, she instead opted to remain a Khaliph, as she had received a vision from Khelefret that, in their time of greatest need, a True Emperor would return to rule, but that in the meantime, the Caliphs would tend to Khelefret’s people.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, the peace forged here would not last. Within a few decades, conflicts started anew, this time starting in the North, where the Remaining Shahs fought for supremacy, and a few decades later, a disagreement over a piece of Khelefretian Dogma led to an ugly schism, and so on and so forth. Minor skirmishes, conflicts, political scrabbles, and the occasional civil war cropped up in the Empire, and more and more, it became impossible to truly call it an Empire anymore.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Approximately 2,000 years ago, the Lycan Empire had secured a firm grasp on the upper mainland continent. The Satrapies, as they were called by Lycan forces, were buffered against this by their Southern Dwarven foes: This, combined with the difficult prospect of fighting in their largely hot and arid holdings against foes hardened by several generations of infighting made them a firm barrier against further Lycan expansion, and ultimately a number of painful military defeats saw the Lycan push turned back. However, ultimately, the Satrapies role in the downfall of the Lycan Empire would not be a military one, but an economic one.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hobgoblins had long been aware of the benefits of trade: Trading between the various holdings and isolated settlements of the Empire was a vital part of keeping everyone well equipped and alive. Trade between the Empire and the Gnomish Kingdom had further cemented the importance of it to their economy: It was through the Gnomes that they discovered that their deserts contained numerous valuable alchemical components. At around the same time that the Lycan Empire was beating on their Northern Gates, Traderships from the southern docks were making their way Northward, eventually finding the Central Sea and the numerous Human and Halfling settlements scattered around it. The trade routes founded by these ships would become invaluable for those forces rebelling against the Lycans in future centuries, as through them would come supplies of food, weapons, goods, and other various necessities that would become necessary for their rebellion.</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And so, Around 1800 years ago, where we left off last time, the Satrapies were doing quite well for themselves. Fat on their heavily entrenched trade routes between the gnomes, their own rich desert and plain, and the rest of the Mainland, they enjoyed a fairly significant wealth per capita as the wealthy trade sultans splurged their earnings on the trappings of wealth and prosperity, trickling-down the wealth to the craftsmen and laborers. They would use this wealth to slowly ramp up production in order to keep up with demand as the Rebellion entered its final stages. Their role as an anchor of stability to a rapidly destabilizing Mainland is remembered to this day, and is one of many reasons that Hobgoblin trade is still so heavily entrenched. However, as we will see before too long, the beginnings of the Wizard War can shake even their foundations...</span><br/><span class="rvts18"></span><br/><span class="rvts18">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But I see we’re out of time. Tonight, I want you to do reading on the next chapter, and pay extra attention to the inventions introduced by the Hobgoblin traders of this time, especially as they juxtaposed with the Magical renaissance brought by the first large-scale Elven contact with the Mainland."</span></p>
