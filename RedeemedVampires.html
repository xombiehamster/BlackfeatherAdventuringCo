            <h2>Redeemed Vampires</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15">The Redeemed Vampire is a recent phenomena. With the rise of the UNEN, vampires have a place they can go where they will not be immediately attacked. While most vampires have long since given in to their hunger for blood, a small number of them have always fought against their nature. In the past, this was always a losing battle- the vampire would eventually either die of starvation, or kill enough people that they would give up their grasp on morality. Living in the UNENS, however, changes the options. With numerous living individuals around that can supply blood willingly and safely, suddenly it was possible to live a normal (for the UNENS) life as a vampire. In a nation that understands their suffering, many vampires suddenly realized there may be hope for them after all. Upon a serious push from several vampire residents, necromantic researchers put forth a serious effort to finding a cure for vampirism.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After decades of research and serious devoted work at the topic of how to defeat the Hunger of being a child of the night, certain daylight-inhibited UNEN members have found an answer. &nbsp;These vampires have found something of a cure, involving devoted study, a massively modified version of the Conversion ritual used for creating Necropolitans, and a true dedication to the cause of dulling the Hunger and putting aside many of the benefits of drinking the great Life Vitality of the sentient living. It modifies the energies of the vampire to slightly more closely emulate a necropolitan- still quite undead, but simulating life and keeping the individual's psyche separate from negative energy.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; While not truly a cure, it does quite greatly change what it is to be a vampire. Those who undergo the redemption ritual (which is very long and painful) still crave blood, but they must no longer also tear away the life force of the living. They can drink either human or animal blood to sustain themselves, and don't need to do so directly. In addition, the weaknesses of a vampire are greatly reduced- they do not suffer as badly from many of the traditional weaknesses, and can even go outside in daylight- thought true sunlight touching their skin or eyes is excruciatingly painful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It all comes at a cost, however. The vampire loses a great deal of the power that comes from vampirism. Many of the abilities granted by their unlife disappear entirely, while others are vastly weakened. Many true vampires call redeemed vampires "neutered" vampires, or other even more derogatory terms. In addition, most outsiders still see the redeemed as vampires- with all the mistrust, suspicion, and hatred that comes with it (though not necessarily as bad as it was in the past.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; Most redeemed go through the ritual because they want to improve themselves. This means that most redeemed vampires are good or neutral. Most evil vampires see no problem whatsoever with their condition, or even enjoy it. A few evil vampires go through the ritual in order to increase their flexibility, however.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Redeemed vampires can not create spawn. &nbsp;They can not pass on their vampirism in any way.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">Redeemed Vampire is a +1 template that must be applied to a Base Creature that also has the&nbsp;</span><a class="rvts36" href="http://xombiehamster.synology.me/adventurer-s-travel-guide/raceguide/uncommon-races/modern-undead/necropolitans.html">Necropolitan</a><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;template. &nbsp;Typically they will not be of an evil alignment.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Sunlight Powerlessness</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; The redeemed vampire is&nbsp;</span><a class="rvts36" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;when touched by any natural sunlight. &nbsp;(The Daylight spell does not count) &nbsp;They must wear a veil, goggles, or smoked lens glasses as well as completely concealing clothing to function outdoors during the day.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Blood Hunger</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts13">&nbsp; &nbsp; The redeemed vampire suffers from a dulled down version of the Hunger suffered by all vampires. &nbsp;Every day the redeemed goes without drinking blood (which need not be fresh) they must make a Will save DC 10 + the number of days they've gone without blood or suffer a 1 point of damage to all mental stats. &nbsp;If the redeemed is reduced to 3 or less in any mental stat they become crazed and with perfect precision find the closest sentient creature with blood and begin to feed. &nbsp;The Blood Craze ends one round after they stop feeding, if they have taken blood from the victim. &nbsp;Once they have begun to feed they will not be able to stop on their own. &nbsp;Treat this as a barbarian rage with blindsight 30 feet to any creature with a beating heart during which the player does not have control over the character's actions. &nbsp;After recovering successfully from a Blood Craze the redeemed suffers horrible guilt for their irresponsibility and their actions while crazed and suffers a -2 penalty to all rolls for 24 hours. &nbsp;If they kill a victim with their licking bite while in the Craze, they lose redemption and regain vampire abilities while also becoming permanently&nbsp;Chaotic Evil and bereft of all sanity.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Blood Healing</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">The redeemed vampire does not drain the energy of their donor or victim, but instead simply takes the blood. &nbsp;They require blood to heal, and when drinking blood receive half the damage dealt by their licking bite back as hit points regained. &nbsp;They may keep flasks of blood for the same effect as a potion of cure light wounds, but a non--magic flask of blood has a shelf life of about 2 weeks.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Bite&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">1d4 + Str + 1d4 bleeding</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Licking Bite</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">When the redeemed vampire has a victim or donor in a grapple, pinned, or otherwise helpless, they may lick at the wound caused by their bite attack to gain the benefit of Blood Healing in an attack. &nbsp;If the licking bite would kill a victim or donor, the redeemed gets the chance to make a reflex save DC 15 to recoil in horror before the victim or donor is dead. &nbsp;If their licking bite kills a victim or donor they lose their redemption and regain all vampire abilities. &nbsp;When not in the middle of a Blood Craze, the vampire can stop consuming the blood of their victim at any point. &nbsp;If this is a player character, they permanently lose control of the character as the redeemed has become a true vampire once again, their alignment changes permanently to Chaotic Evil, and are no longer a playable race at all. &nbsp;If a redeemed narrowly avoids drinking the blood of a dying person they are wracked with guilt and suffer a -2 penalty to all rolls for the next 48 hours or until an atonement is cast. &nbsp;There is no penalty for killing an animal or otherwise non-sentient creature by draining their blood while feeding. &nbsp;Redeemed vampires are not required to be vegetarians, just not kill&nbsp;sentient beings&nbsp;while feeding.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Natural Armor</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;+2</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Damage Reduction</span><span class="rvts13">&nbsp;5/silver (mithril counts as silver for the purpose of defeating this DR)</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Shadowless</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts13">The redeemed casts neither a shadow nor a reflection.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts21">Vampire Weaknesses</span></p>

Unlike other vampires, they do not require a coffin or any form of grave dirt.</span></p>
