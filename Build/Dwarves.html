            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">The Short</span><span class="rvts56">(heh)</span><span class="rvts53">&nbsp;Version</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #c7c7c7;  background-color : #c7c7c7; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Short, sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry. The Dwarves of The World are known for their dedication to tradition, their skill in craftsmanship, and their stoic, gruff attitude towards anything that doesn't fall in the first two categories.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts57"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">If you are a dwarf, most people will expect you to be easy to annoy, but difficult to provoke.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be suspicious of anyone who isn't a dwarf, but to be unwaveringly forthright and honest in all their dealings.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be stubborn about your beliefs and behavior, but similarly stubborn in defending your allies and friends from harm or harassment.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Stout and hardy, dwarves are known for their physical prowess and almost preternatural endurance. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, Dwarves are so broad and compact that they can easily weigh more than 200 pounds. Their broad frame and low center of gravity give them a significant amount of stability, although their short legspan means that they have difficulty keeping stride with most taller races.Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a nearly marble white, although the Duergar people are of particular note for their ashen complexion. One reliable way to gauge the age of a dwarf is to look at their face (often the only exposed part of a dwarf). Younger Dwarves tend to have rosier cheeks and noses as their bodies have not yet fully acclimated to the regular alcohol intake of the dwarf's staple diet.Their hair, which is frequently worn long but rarely adorned, is usually colored black, brown, or red. As a dwarf ages, this color tends to shift first to grey, then to white, although the latter is rare in Dwarves younger than 250 years. There is a common belief that Dwarves take special pride in their beards, as many Dwarves are wont to decorate or embroider them, and although this is true for some Dwarven cultures, for most this is simply a practical matter. Dwarven beard hair is tough, fibrous, difficult to shave, and grows quickly; attempting to keep a beard short or shaved is an exercise in futility.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Dwarves generally tend to group themselves into three groups:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts45">Mountain Dwarves</span><span class="rvts44">, which generally refers to the Dwarves who remained in the Southern Mountain ranges their species evolved in, who maintain a rigorous program of martial training and physical fitness due to their Traditional Enemies, the Goblinoids</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts45">Hill Dwarves</span><span class="rvts44">, also called City Dwarves, Flatlander Dwarves, Sea Dwarves and many other names, is the general term Mountain Dwarves have for all other kinds of Dwarves, even those who also happen to live in mountains. This distinction is mostly ignored by other Dwarves, who consider themselves to be normal examples of just plain Dwarves, with Mountain Dwarves being unusually, even uncomfortably swole in comparison, but more brittle. This results in a very long racist joke that requires some in-depth understanding of metallurgical terms like ductility to get, which is without fail incredibly boring for non-Dwarves.</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts45">Duergar</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;are an unusual offshoot of the Dwarven Line; due to various environmental pressures, they have a tendency towards innate magical capabilities that most Dwarves lack.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Dwarves are believed to be the very first people to make records of events, carving them into the caves and tunnels where they lived and hunted; some even theorize that the pictographs and proto-alphabet that emerged from these cavemarks may have predated the spoken Dwarven language. Owing to these long-lasting messages from generations past, history, and the traditions, laws, and customs it carries, are practically a sacred subject to Dwarves. This is best demonstrated through the Dwarven concept of "Precedent"; in short, this is the belief that, for any undertaking or problem, a Dwarf who looks to the actions of his ancestors will find either a solution or, at worst, a similar enough situation that the best way to proceed may be derived from it. To a Dwarf, the truest mark of wisdom is how well one knows their history, so that they may be blessed to repeat it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">This is not to say that Dwarves eschew innovation; rather, they prefer to see any new thing as a simple evolution of an existing thing. No Dwarven smith in his right mind would claim that his ancestors knew better ways to forge steel or craft crossbow parts, but they recognize that without the generations of knowledge and infrastructure that came before him, he would never have been able to perform such tasks. To honor these gifts from the past, many Dwarven smiths will insist on their apprentices learning every step on the road of history that brought them there, learning first how to make stoneware, in order to make charcoal, in order to smelt bronze, in order to have tools to extract iron and coal, etc etc. It is because of this meticulous attention to detail and respect for the lessons of the past that Dwarves have the highest success(read:survival) rate among apprentice Arcane magic users, and consequently one of the largest number of Arcanists per-capita of all the Common Races.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Now, while Dwarves may agree that the history and traditions of their ancestors are of paramount importance, what exactly these traditions </span><span class="rvts45">are</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;is a subject of frequent, and often violent, debate.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Southern Mountains</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts58"></span><br/><span class="rvts44">Dwarves of the Southern Mountains believe that the first and foremost tradition of Dwarvenkind is their Martial Prowess. This is hardly surprising, given their proximity to their ancestral foes, the goblinoids. However, this militant stance has had a curious side effect of making them more prone to internecine warfare than other Dwarven communities; in fact, the crisscrossing nature of the various demilitarized zones and border caverns claimed as the result of these frequent hostilities means that a significant portion of the mountains are bereft of Dwarven settlement, which has allowed all manner of unusual creatures and civilizations to grow up in the gaps left by Dwarven society.</span></p>
<p class="rvps23"><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/manifestdestinysetting/adventurer-s-travel-guide/raceguide/common_races/dwarves/SouthernMountains.png?attredirects=0"><img width="200" height="123" alt="" src="lib/NewItem6.png"></a></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">The Southern Mountains plays host to many of the oldest Dwarven Holds, including:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Ironfisting Hold, famed for their nearly impregnable (and inaccessible) Stalactowers, and whose ancestors were one of the first to uncover the secrets of pig iron;</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Bronzedbooks Hold, treasured by Dwarven culture for its long tradition in training the deep-diving Aberrant Hunters, Elite regiments dedicated to cleansing the caverns and valleys of the mountains of all manner of foul creatures who lurk there;</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">And the now Infamous Crownedshead Hold; previously recognized as the seat of the original Dwarven Empire which shattered during the Wizard War, in recent years its Royal Line was overthrown by a Socialist Revolution. Although The Party's ironclad grip on production actually improved their military might enough to forestall attacks from other Southern Holds, they then became embroiled in the disastrous Underwar, described elsewhere.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Eastern Mountains</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts57"></span><br/><span class="rvts44">Dwarves of the Eastern Mountains believe that the finest example of a True Dwarf is their attention to Craftsdwarfship. This is in part due to the unfortunate scarcity of mineral wealth within these ranges, which prompted the Dwarves living there to become true masters of the arts of Masonry; structures, furniture, tools, utensils, dishware and more are carefully chiseled and polished by their esteemed stonesmiths, and through the application of advanced Mineralurgy, they are able to cast stones capable of enduring centuries of wear and tear with minimal maintenance.</span></p>
<p class="rvps23"><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/manifestdestinysetting/adventurer-s-travel-guide/raceguide/common_races/dwarves/Eastern%20Mountains.png?attredirects=0"><img alt="" src="lib/NewItem5.png"></a></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">However, while this bounty of beauty may make every hold in the Eastern Mountains glamorous beyond compare, resplendent with reliefs and friezes, it doesn't exactly put mushrooms on the table by itself. More than any other Dwarven subculture, Eastern Mountain dwarves are reliant on regular trade and barter with other Dwarves and Lowlanders to keep their coffers and bellies full; for this reason, the vast majority of Lowlander Dwarves (a general term for Dwarven families that live outside of the mountains) originate from Eastern Holds, a fact that is either a point of pride or a mark of shame depending on which Dwarf you talk to.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">The Eastern Mountains are where you will find some of the most intricately constructed Holds, including;</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Treesanguish Hold, known for their masterful, and some would even say deviant, use of fast-growing Mountain Pines in their architecture and industry, including places where you wouldn't really expect wood to be used.</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Sunchants the Ultimate Peak Hold, one of the richer holds of the Eastern Mountains owing to their substantial ore deposits.&nbsp; Masters of metalcraft even by Dwarven standards, their smiths are said to be able to fold iron up to 100 times in order to pack more of it into their shipments to other holds.</span></li>
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Blazefurnace Hold, known for their mastery of alchemical admixtures, and the first to craft the now famous Stoneplate armor, made from treated stone which is as hard as steel and only three times as heavy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts58"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Lonely Mountains</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts58"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps23"><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/manifestdestinysetting/adventurer-s-travel-guide/raceguide/common_races/dwarves/LonelyMountains.png?attredirects=0"><img width="167" height="200" alt="" src="lib/NewItem4.png"></a></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Dwarves of the Lonely Mountains believe that the true mark of a Dwarf is Financial Sense. This is partially influenced by the isolated nature of the small cluster of mountains that mark the break between the Southern and Eastern mountain ranges; early on in their history, the Holds that made up the scattered Lonely Mountains were individually poor, managing to hold on only by careful control and expenditure of resources. However, as their miners delved deeper, they found a new reason to monitor wealth; namely, to watch it stack up as they found that the Lonely Mountains play host to unusually rich veins of silver, copper, elemental iron, lead and molybdenum. Since then, the Lonely Mountains have been the Iron Basket of the Dwarven Holds, although lacking a steady source of coal, they have difficulty producing steel on their own. Still, the traditions of their impoverished ancestors mean that in spite of the vast wealth of these holds, they do little to demonstrate it, eschewing fancy displays or frippery. This has lead to persistent rumors of vast underground treasure holds, since all that money has to be going </span><span class="rvts45">somewhere.</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">While each of the Lonely Mountains is a famous one in their own right, the greatest among them is:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 40px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
<li class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">Scalesguard Hold, universally considered to be the Mercantile Hub of Dwarvenkind, and perhaps of the Mainland Continent. A great deal of their success can be attributed to the wise financial policies instituted by their royal family, the Ven's; Currently under the rule of Dwar Ven the 9th, who bears a striking resemblance to his father, this wise king continues to uphold the hold's traditional focuses on gold accumulation, delicious sheep ranching, and zero tolerance for dragons of any kind. The family is quite firm on this last part, and has a longstanding tradition of hatred for these scaled menaces: history tells of the bravery of King Dwar Ven the 1st, who, along with revered Swordsdwarves Nota Y. Vern and Noscale Shear, drove a series of dragons away from Scalesguard, the pitiful creatures' flight evident for all to see. The sons and daughters of these noble heroes continue to serve the crown dutifully.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts43"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55">Glacial Caverns</span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts55"></span><br/><span class="rvts44">The Dwarves of the Glacial Caverns, often called Arctic Dwarves or, natively, Duergar, are one of the more extreme offshoots of Dwarvenkind, possessing an ashen pallor and an unusual sense for trickery. This may be in large part due to their longstanding Alliegemnity with their close neighbors, the Drow, an elf offshoot that is described elsewhere.</span></p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts44">While Dwarven society would seem to discourage the sort of wanderlust and unconventional thinking that is the hallmark of most Adventurers, Dwarven history actually provides numerous precedents for lone or sparsely accompanied Dwarven Heroes who set out on Quests to defeat some evil or recover some precious artifact. These sagas often form the inspiration for thousands of young Dwarves to go into the world and right wrongs, aid the downtrodden, and seek vast riches. Many of these, especially if they wander into the Flatlands, will then discover that these Sagas are largely full of goat manure. Those who keep at it, however, will find that their services are often in high demand; the Dwarven reputation for stout bodies and honest labor makes many potential employers more comfortable trusting their problems to Dwarven adventurers over more fickle or untrustworthy races.</span></p>
