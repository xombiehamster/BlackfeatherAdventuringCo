            <h2>Tengu</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<h3 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts19">Society:</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">The Tengu have had greatly changeable fortunes over the centuries, and throughout history have largely kept to small, sometimes nomadic communities. However in the last couple centuries or so, many of these small bands have formed larger, generally stationary communities, and even something of a true hierarchical structure.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">The most prominent Tengu societies are generally divided into large family groups made up of a single bloodline, those married into or adopted into that family line, and those beholden to the family. Almost all Tengu in these larger societies owe their allegiance to one larger family or another, although they do not refer to these family groups as nobility. That is, however, the analogue most outside societies draw when observing this structure. Each family group manages its own affairs and generally answers to the family’s patriarch or matriarch.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Certain family groups are considered to have higher status among Tengu society, sometimes enough so that they might be considered essentially royalty to the casual observer. The entire societal structure is considerably less formal than those of many other cultures, however, and while a certain amount of pomp and posturing is certainly a part of Tengu culture, they don’t focus very heavily on what other cultures might consider proper or improper behavior. They truly do act more like casual, massive families than one might expect from a ‘noble’ house, and meetings of the equivalent of multiple Tengu noble houses often look more like massive potlucks than official meetings of any kind.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">The Tengu have several of these larger communities, some of them isolated, and some at least partially integrated into other, non-Tengu communities. In their personal affairs, they pay little mind to what those of any other society have to say, although if others attempt to interfere with their culture they will promptly move to defend what’s theirs. For the most part they don’t result to extreme violence in these cases, but they are not entirely opposed to the idea if it becomes necessary. Almost all Tengu have some training with blades, and this training is considered a point of pride among them, as well as a useful skill when it does become necessary to defend themselves.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Despite the fact that they keep very much to themselves when it comes to personal and familial matters, Tengu have no fear of venturing out into the rest of the world. They are innately curious, enjoy travel and discovery, and have an eye for a bargain. The larger of the Tengu communities rapidly established trade with as many nearby societies as possible, as well as with other Tengu communities. They are fascinated by the goods, culture, and stories of other races, and as a result many of them venture far beyond their own homes for the sake of discovery and exploration, although most return home from time to time both to spend time with their families and to share what they’ve learned and picked up on their travels.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Other races consider Tengu to be opportunistic, nosy, and generally obnoxious. In fairness, they frequently are. Tengu are always looking for good opportunities for trade and discovery, sometimes crossing cultural boundaries to get what they want, and they don’t have much opposition to at least minor theft, especially from non-Tengus. A single Tengu can be quite loud, and a group of them can be unbearable. They don’t have a great deal of innate respect for cultures and races beyond their own, although with time and learning they can gain some amount of understanding, and indeed strive to on numerous occasions. However they do have a great loyalty to their own people, and even Tengu who don’t know one another will treat each other politely. They have strong bonds to their families and communities, and woe betide the one who causes harm to even a single Tengu where others might hear of it, especially a Tengu with strong family ties.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"></span><br/><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps7"><a name="TOC-APPEARANCE:"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts19">Appearance:</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Tengu primarily take after crows and ravens in appearance, with broad tails and slightly iridescent black feathers. Some sport something of a ‘beard’ of feathers, and some retain largely vestigial flight feathers on their forelimbs, although these pseudo-wings can be used to slow a fall from a great height.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Though the majority of Tengu have solid black feathers, many do take after other species of corvid instead, bearing the black and white markings of magpies or rooks, or the blues and grays of certain species of jay. Some sport pointed crests on their heads, or longer, narrower tails. Specific patterns and colors run in families, although generations of crossover between family lines have produced new and unique markings and feather configuration.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Leucism and albinism are also not unheard of, and these rare white Tengu, while not necessarily revered, often provide bragging rights for the family to which they belong.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Tengu also have a great love of decoration. Most wear at least some jewelry, and feather- and beak-painting is not an uncommon practice. They generally favor brightly colored clothing, and even those who prefer or require subtler attire enjoy intricate designs and patterns on their outfits.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"></span><br/><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps7"><a name="TOC-TENGU-AND-FIREARMS:"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts19">Tengu and Firearms:</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">The Tengu who first encountered firearms had the poor fortune to be on the receiving end during a small conflict with the local Hobgoblin forces. In true Tengu fashion a much larger and better prepared band soon descended on the offending Hobgoblins, and brought this strange new weapon back to their homes for examination. Their innate curiosity led to nonstop fiddling with their new discovery until they knew not only how it worked, but how to produce similar weapons of their own.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Given the cultural propensity for bladed weapons, most Tengu still prefer swords and knives to firearms, but knowledge of firearms spread quite rapidly through their society and some few have taken a shine to the weapons. A small but dedicated number of Tengu have spent the last two or three generations learning to reliably produce and use firearms of their own, and one or two specific families have become experts on the matter.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts28">Tengu in general favor smaller, lighter weapons, given their stature. Pistols and other one-handed weapons are favored, but muskets and the like are far from unknown. Tengu firearms are often somewhat ostentatious, bearing intricate decoration, although Tengu gunsmiths would never think to favor decoration over utility, and even their most decorative firearms still function as well as any other.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts15"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">Those who favor firearms over bladed weapons take the same pride in their ability to use them as many Tengu do in their skill with swords. Their skill with guns is is a point of pride to those who use them, and they will train frequently with them to retain these skills. Many have also learned that firearms have certain advantages over blades. They often find the sheer noise of a firearm to be incredibly satisfying, and the intimidation factor of such a weapon is not lost on the Tengu who wield them.</span></p>
