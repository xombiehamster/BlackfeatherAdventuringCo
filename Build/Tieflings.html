            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">The Short&nbsp;Version</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #c7c7c7;  background-color : #c7c7c7; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Otherworldly, isolationist creatures known to have extraplanar origins. The Tieflings of The World are known for their unpredictable appearance, their innate connection to the dangerous interplanar creatures, and their tight-knit communities.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">If you are a tiefling, people will expect you to consort with dark powers, but be willing to use them for profit rather than destruction.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to either be, or know, a criminal, but that your crimes are mostly on the supply side.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to act brazenly and irreverently, but that you would never disappoint those you call family.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While some races, like elves, are difficult to pin down physically because of extensive variation in phenotypes, Tieflings are nearly impossible to definitively describe as they are not actually of singular descent. "Tiefling" is actually just a generally accepted term by census-takers for those individuals whose geneology was significantly influenced, altered, or descended from Outsiders, specifically those lumped into the category of "Fiends", owing to their destructive, violent, and generally antisocial approach to material interactions. While the innumerable way in which these creatures are capable of influencing one's heredity is beyond the scope, and comfort level, of this publication, suffice to say that once one of these creatures has made it's mark on a bloodline, rarely does that mark fade. As such, Tieflings may come from a wide variety of origins, be they born to other tieflings, or have only one tiefling parent, or being entirely new tieflings. Indeed, there are rumors(though unsubstantiated ones) that some Fiends have the ability to permanently transmute an individual into a Tiefling. As such, with thousands (and likely more) of possible heredities that any given tiefling may inherit from their progenitors, it can be difficult enough to conclusively state the appearance of these newborn halflings, let alone those who are the result of unions between two different types of tiefling.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">So, now that we've explained why you can't really describe a tiefling, let's give it a try anyway.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The vast majority of tieflings will bear some hints of their Fiendish origins; most typically, this will take the form of some body structure of the fiend in question appearing on the Tiefling. For example, those descended from Cornugons will have massive horns upon their crowns, those of Vrock descent may have massive runs of feathers, those with Rakshasa blood may have inverted hands, etc etc. Unfortunately, the fact that many of these features are animalistic in nature may make it difficult to separate them from the innumerable other animal-esque peoples, like mongrelfolk. Fortunately, typically they can also be differentiated by their unusual pigmentation in hair, eyes, skin and, occasionally, claws, fangs, or other such features. However, if there's a pressing need to determine if someone truly is a tiefling and not otherwise, there are two tried and true methods, one more reliable, the other more acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The most reliable method is to try to set them on fire. All tieflings, regardless of lineage, seem to possess an unusual level of resistance to open flame; although not completely immune, it will be easy to see how their flesh resists normal blackening and blistering. This has made it the method of choice for innumerable centuries of inquisitions, villagefolk, and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The more acceptable method is to see what company they keep.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As mentioned elsewhere in this publication, half-breeds tend to take on the cultural attributes of their parent races, or whichever municipality they are born into. This is significantly complicated in the case of tieflings, as any tiefling not born of other tieflings will likely have at least one parent who is totally absent (Fiends not being known for winning parent of the year awards), and the culture into which they are born is unlikely to immediately accept them; even the most liberal of cultures tends to frown on consorting with the literal physical embodiment of destruction, death, and violence. However, since tieflings across The World have had to endure millenia of this kind of semi-justified prejudice, they ultimately realized that the most efficient way to avoid the scorn and prejudice of others was to do just that; avoid them. While for much of history this meant that most tieflings lived in self-imposed exile, whether plotting vengeance on those who cast them out or just wanting to be left alone, within the last few centuries some of them landed on a new strategy; strength in numbers.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The earliest tiefling communities were largely nomadic; travelling together from town to town, they would stop long enough to peddle their natural ability to channel the powers of the Outer planes to shock and amaze village people, make a few exchanges of curatives, curses, and totems against evil spirits (who better to know evil spirits than someone whose parent was one?), and then leave before tempers and fears could accumulate too much. Occasionally, they would find such a village to be harboring a tiefling among their number; these tieflings would be convinced to join their bretheren, because while tieflings may not all come from the same family, species, or indeed from the same plane of existence, they were unified by the universal disdain for their kind. Needless to say, for reasons that only the most learned and/or perverted of Extraplanar Scholars could tell you, the fact that they came from thousands of different outsider sources had no impact on their ability to grow their population. As the numbers of a given group would increase beyond manageable size, it was inevitable that some event, be it an agreement or a disagreement, would cause the group to separate. Many smaller groups of tieflings continue to live like this to this day, but others eventually grew to such a large number without separating that such nomadic living was no longer sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">This gave rise to the first Little Inferno.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">No one knows where the first of these communities got its start, but the method by which it happened is well understood; a large number of tieflings would make their way to a heavily populated area, and then, rather than just staying a while to peddle their wares, they would set down roots. Sometimes, they would start building their own homes; other times, they would simply move into ones abandoned by previous owners who had no desire to live next to such fearsome creatures. The tieflings themselves would speed up this process, intentionally or not, by being themselves; taking to the streets and openly engaging in peddling, gambling, or even simple conversation, congregated in small circles in public places. This behavior, called "squatting" even though many tieflings are actually incapable of that specific motion, was a common and innocuous social gathering in the tiefling's nomadic communities, but the sight of so many otherworldly beings congregated together would unnerve all but the most staid of citizens. Eventually, they would come to occupy the emptied neighborhood, and thus become a permanent fixture. Often called Little Inferno or Demontown or Hell's Kitchen, these insular communities would keep largely to themselves, resisting most efforts to integrate or acclimate to their surrounding culture.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Many would assume that the presence of such an untrusted and isolationist community would spark a panic, culminating in them being all run out of town, and in many cases, this is what happened, and occasionally happens even now (refer to the innumerable Civinquisitions of around 100 years ago). In many other cases, however, the Little Infernos would come to be begrudgingly accepted because of the myriad of services they could offer. As mentioned previously, Tieflings have a natural connection to the outer planes; for many of them, this allows them to conjure forth curatives, prophylactics (not usually the ones you're thinking of, but occasionally, those too), and even curses on demand; services that few would admit to using, but nonetheless which offered a handy alternative to seeking the help of religious temples or other institutions of magic, which are known for being a bit judgey at times. From there, their position as the official-unofficial black market for magical services would occasionally grow to them becoming the unofficial black market for, well, normal black market things. While not all tiefling communities went this far, it must be noted that some even openly admit their criminal connections, with their municipalities turning a blind eye for a multitude of reasons.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While this tells a great deal about the formation and structure of tiefling culture, it says very little about their beliefs. In truth, this is because much of their underpinning social mores are relatively unknown to outsiders(meaning not tieflings, not extraplanar beings, although they're probably in the dark as well), and they prefer to keep it that way. However, one of the most obviously important elements of tiefling culture revolves around loyalty to their community. While this is hardly a unique trait, the tight knit nature of tiefling populations mean that even in more metropolitan and diverse municipalities, tieflings will make pains to keep up with the weals and woes of all other tieflings in the city, knowing who needs what, where they need it, and when, and relying on others to do the same should some calamity befall them. Every tiefling is keenly aware of how alone they are except when among their fellows, and treasures each one as dearest family.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While these communities, both nomadic and settled, can now be found across the full span of the Mainland Continent, a few bear special mention due to their size or influence.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Circle Sea City States</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As the Little Infernos thrive best when in a large enough municipality that their activities become largely unnoticeable in the hustle and bustle, it is of little surprise that the largest of them may be found in the vast metropoli of the Circle Sea City States. Although most assume the largest tiefling community would be found in the largest citystate, New Highelf, it actually resides in the slightly smaller Istantinople; evidently, since one of the many services offered by tiefling communities is fortune telling, tieflings are among the first to tell you that living in New Highelf is more trouble than it's worth. However, it's worth noting that these municipal tieflings are considered controversial, not by their fellow citizens, but by other tiefling communities; evidently, these more rural tieflings believe that the city tieflings are beginning to erode their traditional beliefs and practices in favor of acclimating with the Insiders (you can probably guess who those are). While the municipal tieflings deny these allegations, they will likewise lambaste the rural tieflings for being blind to the fact that their traditions need not prevent them from using some of the conveniences of modern living, such as sewers.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Patchquilt Kingdoms</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Within the Patchquilt Kingdoms exists the largest singular accumulation of nomadic tieflings found in the whole of the mainland continent. This band has made it's fortune on the traditional practices of their kind, but also offer a unique entertainment which has thusfar protected them from the usual arguments or crusades which would break up similarly sized communities. Among their number are supremely skilled illusionists, performers, tamers, and those trained in the dark arts of Fairground Food who have come together to form </span><span class="rvts45">The Carnivale of the Damned</span><span class="rvts44">. Although somewhat sinister in name, this celebration of sight and sound has become a cherished part of many annual celebrations within the Patchquilt Kingdoms, and one benefit of having so many different nations is that they all come with their own distinct holidays. Needless to say, many other tiefling communities scorn </span><span class="rvts45">The Carnivale</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;as a mockery of their traditions and beliefs, but it's hard to hear their grousing over the sound of so much silver clinking together.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Eastern Mountains</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While neither large in size nor significant for their unique beliefs, the small number of tiefling communities within the Dwarven Nations of the Eastern Mountains are notable for one thing: The demonstrated adaptability of tieflings. Tieflings are generally not a particularly squat race, but within several generations of settling into the Eastern Mountain Kingdoms, the tiefling communities there began to change in aspect ratio; for reasons none can really explain (not without a lot of throat clearing and awkward silences, anyway), tiefling populations have an unusual tendency to adapt to their surrounding communities physically, even if they resist them culturally. While this behavior can be observed elsewhere, nowhere else is it more readily apparent than what happened in these "Squatterdeep" communities.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Tieflings feel the call to adventure for the same reason many other races do; few can deny that the promise of vast wealth, ancient treasures, and perhaps even unearthed lore of old is a tempting prospect. Tieflings often have a slightly ulterior motive for wanting to head out into the field, often for months at a time, isolated from any communication or contact; </span><span class="rvts45">to get away from their families for a single moment.</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;While the insular and tight-knit nature of tiefling communities appeals to many tieflings, as they feel safest when surrounded by their own, there are those tieflings for whom the constant contact, gossip, and henpecking of their fellow tieflings is smothering. For these tieflings, who are unlikely to be able to find the normal methods of escape such as military service or distant trading, adventuring stands out as an immediately obvious opportunity to work to the benefit of themselves and their community while simultaneously </span><span class="rvts45">escaping</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;said community, even if just temporarily. Of course, many parties and companies are still wary of recruiting an individual descended from entities that would gladly end all life on The World if they could, but attitudes on that are slowly shifting. Helping this are other tieflings who are motivated to adventure, not just to escape, but to make an openly visible example of how tieflings are not (all) evil criminals, and should receive greater acceptance in Mainland Society. Whatever their motivations, few can deny that the natural magical talents of tieflings are unwelcome when faced with unknown dangers, and statistically the chance that their tiefling ally will betray them and sneak off with all of their stuff is </span><span class="rvts45">slightly</span><span class="rvts44">&nbsp;lower than the chance that they'll all horribly die in a centuries old crypt, so most likely that won't be an issue.</span></p>
