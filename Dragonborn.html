<p></p>
<h3 class="rvps22"><a name="sites-page-title-header"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts52">Dragonborn</span></span></h3>
<div class="rvps2"><a name="sites-canvas-main"></a><table width="1035" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style="border-width: 0px; border-spacing: 0px;">
<tr valign="top">
<td valign="top" style="padding: 10px;"><p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">The Short&nbsp;Version</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Hefty, Scaly creatures who manage to compact much of the Might and Majesty of Dragonkind into a more manageable package. The Dragonborn of The World are known for their ancient bloodlines, their regal attitudes, and their unpredictable oral eruptions.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">If you are a Dragonborn, most people will assume that you are well-mannered, but rigid and terse in your dealings.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be the one to keep a cool head in an emergency situation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">They will expect you to be wealthy, confident, and have a plan for any situation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts54"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">One of the largest of the common races, Dragonborn easily exceed 6 feet on average, often massing over 250 pounds. Much of this weight can be attributed to the extremely dense Draconic musculature they have inherited from their ancestry: indeed, Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The scales which cover the Dragonborn can vary wildly not only in color, but also in size and pattern, with some having fine scales which are indistinguishable from flesh at a distance, while others have massive, knobbly scutes. The nature of their scales can tell a great deal about the ancestry of a Dragonborn, as the color is often, but not always, indicative of the Draconic Ancestry in their blood, while the nature and pattern of the scales can often give an indication as to their non-draconic parentage. Additionally, a Dragonborn may possess other unique features, such as ridges, bony protrusions, and keratinous skull features which can range from thick, bony spikes to thick bundles of hairlike strands. Their hands and feet are composed of talonlike claws, with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As mentioned, the scale coloration of a Dragonborn can give an insight into their lineage, but a far more telling indicator is the nature of their Thaumopharynxial Emissions, or, in common parlance, "Breath Weapon." Similar to True Dragons, most Dragonborn are able to collect Thaumic Energy inside their oral cavity, expelling it into an elemental blast; to protect themselves from this emergence, their bodies will also possess a natural resistance to the elemental substance which they are capable of expelling. The nature and pattern of this expulsion can indicate the predominant Draconic parentage. Contrary to popular belief, Dragonborn are in total control of their Breath Weapon; the rumors of breath weapons going off due to illness, pollutants, or contagious yawning are completely erroneous.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While Dragonborn can be found in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, the most common possess long, imbricated scales which indicate their Kobold parentage; indeed, by current census measurements well over 90% of all known Dragonborn in The World trace their lineage directly to the union between Kobold nobility and Draconic suitors.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As with many half-breeds, it is difficult to disentangle any societal quirks that are specifically Dragonborn as opposed to those that are inherited from their parent species. As the vast majority of Dragonborn are raised in one of the Kobold Empires, or at least have origins within one, speaking on their society means doing little more than parroting the ethos and mores of said Empires. In this publication's opinion, this is fine, as while most of the following will be concerning a predominantly Kobold culture, this is a guide to identifying adventurers, and statistically speaking one is far more likely to encounter a Dragonborn Adventurer than a Kobold one.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Kobold societies, and by extension their Dragonborn children, are predominantly regimented, authoritarian, and fascist; they hold the wellness of the city/state/empire above the wellness of the citizens within them, recognizing that while they are individually weak, by working together and being willing to sacrifice for the betterment of all, they can overcome and defend themselves from the traditional enemies of Koboldkind, which generally includes any creature that is larger, stronger, and tougher than a kobold... i.e. most of them. In spite of this general xenophobia, however, the most successful Kobold nations are those who have focused more on isolationism and defense, as historically those who attempted to militarize against these traditional foes often found themselves destroyed in the backlash. As such, these remaining Kobold Empires often find that in spite of their general mistrust of the larger, mammalian races which inhabit most of the Mainland Continent, the nations that they most frequently compete with are, in fact, other Kobold Empires.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While this competition can often be militaristic, it is also equal parts cultural and economic, often centered around one of the greatest endeavors of their ruling classes: namely, attracting Draconic courtiers. For obvious reasons, the more Draconic allies that a Nation or Family can bring to their side, the better; after all, there are few more reliable ways to discourage conquest than the presence of one or more multitonne, fire-breathing citizens. In return, the Dragons they attract are lavished with treasures, feasts, and, most interestingly, company; though naturally solitary creatures, Dragons are just as capable of loneliness as any other sentient race, and Kobold-kind's immunity to their Draconic Fear makes it possible to hold a conversation without the other party shaking uncontrollably. Furthermore, freed from the need to compete for with other Dragons for resources or territory, these Embedded Dragons are able to pursue other studies or arts, putting their immense intelligence to loftier pursuits. The Dragonborn are a natural outcome of this mutually beneficial arrangement; literally so, since unlike many other half-breeds, no magical or divine intercession is required.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As a result of being the physical representation of the alliance between massive, energy breathing reptile and state, the social position of most Dragonborn lies somewhere between National Treasure and Natural Born Leader. Kobold societies more often than not extol the virtues and gifts of their Dragonborn children, believing that their inherited longevity, presence, and physique makes them singularly suited to assume the responsibilities of leadership, although which particular aspect of leadership varies between the various Kobold cultures:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">The Hardscale Empire</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">In the Hardscale Empire, dragonborn are prized for their evenhandedness and keen sense of justice; As such, their dragonborn find themselves huddled into more civic duties, such as advocates, treasurers, and governors. Strangely, this predilection towards public service very rarely reaches the highest levels. There is a longstanding cultural taboo against dragonborn assuming positions of singular power in the Empire, likely due to the events of the disastrous reign of Emperor Croctavian, which gave rise to the Empire's bitter rival, discussed below.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While, like most Kobold Nations, the Empire is distrustful of non-Kobold nations, they nevertheless engage with free trade with many of the other nations of the Mainland Continent. Often, the trade caravans they send out will be administrated or guarded by dragonborn, which makes Hardscale-descended dragonborn one of the most commonly seen kind of dragonborn in the less-developed parts of the Mainland.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">The Gold Republic</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">In the Gold Republic, dragonborn are celebrated for their sheer physical might.&nbsp; They tend to be found in military positions, such as captains, generals, and, just as importantly, weapon and armorsmiths.&nbsp; According to their own census reports, the Republic contains the single greatest concentration of dragonborn citizens found on the Mainland continent, although the extent to which these records may be exaggerated has yet to be established.&nbsp; What is known is that they apparently have the numbers to be able to field entire regiments of dragonborn soldiers,&nbsp;where their brawn allows them to serve as shockingly effective heavy infantry, especially since they are capable of providing their own fire support in a pinch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The aforementioned bitter rival of the Hardscale Empire, the lands of The Gold Republic once were Imperial holdings that seceded from the Empire during the reign of Emperor Croctavian. Since then, they have been at a perpetual state of war with their previous rulers, although currently this amounts to little more than occasional skirmishes... at least, on the surface. There are reports that beneath the surface, a far more bitter war is fought in the tunnels and caverns that lie beneath the Empire and the Republic, but neither is keen on providing much information on this conflict to outsiders.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">The Order of the Red Eye</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">In the Order of the Red Eye, dragonborn are considered to be blessed champions of their state deity, the Red Eye.&nbsp; The vast majority can be found in positions among&nbsp;the clergy, with the most devout among them being recruited into the Red Eye Inquisition, a secretive organization that can be found across the Mainland Continent, searching for artifacts and relics of their god and tracking down those who are considered to be enemies of the Order.&nbsp; While it seems somewhat incongruous that brightly colored, 7 foot, 300 pound reptiles would be entrusted with stealth missions, the fact that they are successful in their endeavors offers chilling evidence of their skill.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The Order as a nation is surprisingly large for it's origins as a cult, which lends some credence to the abilities of their god; however, most credible theologians believe that the Red Eye is not actually a divinity, but more likely a creature of vast power, although the distinction becomes kind of blurred at this scale.&nbsp; However, few of it's neighboring Nations are keen on their existence, but for now, it also seems that few of them are willing to take the chance of angering such a powerful entity.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">The Urbanborn</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">An originally dismissive term that has come to be generally adopted by those it describes, the Urbanborn are those dragonborn who were not born within the Kobold Nations, but rather from either other races commingling with dragons, or from other dragonborn who have opted to leave the nations of their birth, or who may have been Urbanborn themselves.&nbsp; It goes without saying that due to the widespread and disorganized nature of any group that is effectively "None of the Above", it is difficult to attribute any definitive tendencies or habits to these dragonborn, other than to state that they likely adopt much of the ethos of their birthplace and parentage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While Urbanborn are most commonly found in the metropolitan areas of the Circle Sea City States, at the time of writing there is one Castle Kingdom, named "Here There Be Dragons"(probably to annoy cartographers), located within the Patchquilt Kingdoms which claims to be a haven for Dragonborn who wish to live among their own kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">As mentioned previously, dragonborn adventurers are encountered more frequently than any of their Kobold ancestors; the reason for this are manifold, but most commonly can be attributed to the fact that in spite of their Kobold lineage, not all dragonborn are, well, born with the same instinctual need for strength in numbers and suppression of individuality. Indeed, their draconian-inherited instincts can make many of them extremely uncomfortable with the constant demands and responsibilities that are supposedly their birthrights. While most dragonborn who display such anti-social behavior are quietly shuffled into roles where they have fewer stresses, some of them go all the way in the opposite direction, preferring a life of relative isolation and constant danger... i.e. adventuring. Struck by a need to escape the hustle and bustle, many of them will set out ill prepared and uninformed, but the natural hardiness and brawn of their kind give them better odds than most other impetuous heroes.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">That said, not all who adventure are lost; many of them find reason to set off into the wider world in order to help their parent nations, be it with new knowledge, unique experiences, or even just a steady donation of gold for the more poverty-stricken set. Some nations, including the Hardscale Empire, are more likely to encourage this behavior, believing that the actions of these brave children of their nation will bring prestige and recognition for the typically ignored Kobold nations. Those who are encouraged to adventure are usually shied towards Adventuring Companies known for their acceptance of dragonborn, such as the Reptile Rangers, the Lizardmensch, or, cough cough, Blackfeather.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Still, for every dragonborn adventurer hailing from Kobold lands, there is one who comes from the ranks of the Urbanborn; after all, when you're a massive, scale-strapped individual with about 100 pounds on your next door neighbor, and your options for careers that can make use of the fact that you can literally exhale poison are either fumigator or adventurer... well, it's not hard to see why many are attracted to use their natural talents towards more dangerous endeavors.</span></p>
