            <h2>Serpeggaire</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare is a nation as complex and contradictory as its people. It is a state that is at once tyrannical and libertarian, segregated and liberated. They value creativity, artistry, and beauty; but also cunning, deceit, and stealth. The Serpente people are different than most other societies, having very different familial structures and moral outlooks. While they are not evil, strictly, their morality and society can be quite confusing to outsiders, and is considered more than a little grey.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare is a city state, and the Serpente fall into generally two subspecies. They are called the lowbloods and purebloods. The only difference is that lowbloods have legs, and purebloods have a thick, muscular tail. There is no other difference. Serpeggiare has a caste system (though it is more political than societal,) and it is generally divided along those lines.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">The Serpente are said to have been grown from snakes thousands of years ago, created by the Snake-Gods (Specifically Drakaulos the Dark-scale) in order to bring the serpentine to the forefront of the world. The Serpente generally do not have traditional family structures, but family is important to them.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Due to the fact that they are hatched by eggs, and their propensity towards orgies, the mother is generally seen as the primary parent and caretaker in their society. Exclusive monogamous and polygamous relationships both exist in Serpente society, but the mother is seen as the lynchpin for both. Given this, women are generally the more ambitious of the two genders and gravitate towards positions of power. It is by no means a matriarchal society, but most of the faces on their currency are feminine.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Serpente view cunning as the most desirable personality aspect. They also view intelligence, charisma, and creativity as expressions of cunning, and thus these are very desirable and respected qualities for an individual to have</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Given this, Serpente culture is very rich. Art, literature, theater, song, dance, and nearly any creative pursuit is viewed as a respectable career. Anyone, high society or low, will generally enjoy at least a little bit of cultural enrichment. Their culture has produced many amazing artists, poets, actors, and their dancing is quite impressive. There is a rich art scene in nearly any district of the city, and many artists become famous enough that they actually have a good deal of money and political clout.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Since Serpente art is largely geared towards cunning, it can seem a little dense to outsiders. Serpente love beauty and vibrant colors (Generally as a reflection of their own bright colors,) but love art that require effort or intellectualism to understand. Their art tends toward the abstract, and their literature and plays tend to have complex and interwoven plots.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts40"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Castes are generally divided into four groups. The high blooded, the Mercenary families, the low-bloods, and the nameless. Of the four, the high-bloods are the only exclusive pure blood group.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts40"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">The high bloods include most of the ruling families. They almost exclusively play politics, and it gets extremely cutthroat. One of the most valued traits among the Serpente is cunning, and the high-blood families take this to an extreme degree. They constantly are in a cold war with one another. Generally, whichever family holds the ruling Duchess or Duke is “On top.”</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare is ruled by a Duke or Duchess, who is picked from one of the ruling High Families. The Duchess has explicit power, and generally sets up a court. The Court is usually made up of members of the Duchess’ own family, each assigned to political roles that they wish to control. Sometimes non-family members achieve positions of power, but this is generally only true if they have political pull to get there or are the only one really qualified for it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">A Duchess is usually only removed from power if there is significant public opinion against them. The Mercenary families, High families, and influential low-blood families all have significant community ties. If the communities put on enough pressure, then the Duchess must make changes or face a popular coup. High families are constantly searching for ways to use this to influence politics.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Purebloods who hate politics or just don’t want to be involved in all that political backbiting generally join the High Cult or join the Mercenary families. Both of those options are seen as respectable. Many Purebloods are bankers, and they are somewhat shielded from politics. High bloods who just don’t care will frequently join or buy low-blood businesses, but this is looked down on by most Purebloods.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">The Mercenary families are the core of Serpeggiare’s military strength and their police. They are the only caste that is involved at nearly all levels of society. They began as more martial Pureblood families, but over time their role morphed.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">When you join a Mercenary family, you leave your old family behind. Your previous family name (If you had one) is stripped, and you receive the name of your new Mercenary house. In this respect, the Mercenaries really are families. You refer to your compatriots as Brother and Sister, or if they are leadership, Father or Mother.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Mercenary families accept pretty much anybody who has a good head on their shoulders. Low-bloods and Purebloods mix on all ranks. Purebloods are generally favored for officership, but merit is the primary trait looked upon for promotion. As such, joining a Mercenary family is the best way for a low-blood to gain respect from high society and political influence.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Mercenary families pride themselves on professionalism. Though they are just as involved in subterfuge as anyone else, they pride themselves on their Family’s reputation fiercly. If one does something to defame the family name, they are punished severely. Generally, it is by public humiliation and demotion, but name-stripping and expulsion happen. Execution is generally reserved only for murder or treason.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">The Mercenary families are responsible for all policing in Serpeggiare. Since they are private, each district of the city has a contract with one or more Merc families. The exact nature of this contract varies, so policing &nbsp;can be a bit of a confusing network of legal loopholes throughout the city. Merc families are self-policing. They possess their own corruption task forces and do their own internal investigations.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">Thankfully, Merc families live and die by their reputations for professionalism. They take corruption very seriously, and accepting bribes is a good way to get strung up by your toes (Or tail) on an overpass for a day or two. If a Merc family gets a reputation for corruption, they could easily lose all their contracts and thus their income. Given this, corruption is fairly uncommon, though it does happen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps16"><span class="rvts28">It is notable that not all Family members are soldiers or police. The Families need cooks, accountants, engineers, and bureaucrats just as much as any other armed force. However, all must be proficient with at least a handful of weapons, and all must undergo basic combat training.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts40">Crime is something of a fluid concept in Serpeggiare, and the Low-blood families take advantage of this aggressively. Generally, only actions that directly harm another are illegal in Serpeggiare (And tax evasion.) Prostitution, gambling, drugs, alcohol, and any number of unsavory activities are all legal. The low-blood families run this activities almost exclusively, and are similar in many respects to organized criminals.</span><span class="rvts28">&nbsp;The low-blood families are primarily economic in nature, and as such will accept anyone of note or import. Many of their members rose up from the dregs of society, and many of their membership have wealth and influence that rival Purebloods.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The lowblood families are vicious in protecting their business interest. Blackmail, extortion, bribery, and violence (All of which are illegal) are frequently used to keep their interests in line. The exact level of competition among the families varies. Sometimes, little to no crime is committed. If the economy is tight, it can get brutal.</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">The lowest caste is the No-names. A No-name is someone with no family title whatsoever. While some orphans or unwanted children end up as No-names, the majority of No-names lost their family name (Or never got one) due to their own actions or inactions.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Adoption, marriage, and joining a Mercenary family are all ways for a Serpente with no last name to move up in the world. However, all of these involve getting someone to like you enough to give you their last name. If the individual in question is lazy, violent, unstable, or just plain a jerk, they may not be able to rise out of this caste.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Serpente are generally only stripped of their name in extreme cases. Incest, violence, or criminality might cause one to be disowned from their family. Betrayal or extreme corruption might get one stripped from the records of a Mercenary clan. Some simply drop out of society for some reason or another.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">In many cases, the No-names are simply homeless or mentally ill. While resources exist for the mentally ill to get help, without any financial resources it is difficult to impossible to receive treatment.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">While no specific laws exist against No-names, it is very difficult for them to get anyone to trust them. Apartments will be reluctant to rent to them, it is practically impossible to get a loan, and employers will be highly critical. Mercenary families will let them join, but only if they show a mindset compatible with their disciplined lifestyle. Low-blood families will occasionally employ No-names as hitters, thieves, or enforcers, but even they are reluctant to trust them.</span><br/><span class="rvts40"></span><br/><span class="rvts28">Serpeggiare itself is a city divided. The original fortress was meant to temporarily hold a population for a few weeks while trouble on the surface died down. It was not meant for long-term living. Soon after the Betrayal (See below), the citizens spread out of the fortress and began to build for themselves. The fortress itself sat on a bluff overlooking a large bio-luminescent lake. The Fortress itself became a compound for the seat of government, its offices, and a few very opulent homes. Pureblood families bought out much of the land around it, and large manor homes are the norm on the bluff. A few discerning banks and other high society businesses are there as well.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">A large spring exists in the middle of the fortress. It flows through the walls of the fort and down the bluff in a dramatic waterfall, where it empties into the lake. It is the main source of fresh water for the city.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The rest of the population spread down the bluff and across the lake. Some construction exists on the shoreline, and some is build into the bluff face itself, but most of it has spread into the lake itself on a system of wharves and canals that is constantly being reinforced. It is slowly becoming a true city.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The low city is a constant buzz of activity at all times. Merchants and low-blood families are already trying to rebuild their businesses, and the streets are usually packed with vendors and advertisement. Entertainment venues, banks, rich homes, Cult dens, poor apartments, and civic buildings are all packed together in a pretty much haphazard way.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">There are several roads up the bluff into the High city, but they are gated and guarded by Mercenary family soldiers. While lowbloods are not banned from entry, those without documented business in the high city can expect to be questioned. Those who appear poor or suspicious can expect to be turned away.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">The city is lit mostly by bio-luminescent lichen found in the lake. Engineers figured out how to cultivate it into wet-lamps, small containers of water that are packed dense with the lichen. The lichen grows in a variety of colors, and it has already been bred to be brighter, so the city tends to be a sea of colors at all hours. Artists have already started adorning walls with frescoes and murals in both the high and low city.</span><br/><span class="rvts28">Trade routes come through the docks, along the bluffs, and up a well-protected side route into the high city itself.</span></p>
