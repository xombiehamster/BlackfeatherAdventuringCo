            <div class="main-content">
                
<p></p>
<p class="rvps5"><span class="rvts53">The Short&nbsp;Version</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #c7c7c7;  background-color : #c7c7c7; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Fractious, numerous creatures who have spread to every niche of the Mainland Continent. The Humans of The World are known for their capability in any field, their divisive subcultures, and their occasional bouts of frenzied obsession.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Physical Description</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">The human body structure seems to be a curious homogenization of several other designs so that they seem to be an ultimate hybrid race; indeed, the Common term "Humanoid" descends from the fact that human body shape is so varied and yet so lacking in detail that, under the right circumstances, a human could appear to be nearly any other intelligent race with little difficulty. This gave rise to the older suspicions that humans were descended from shapeshifters, like doppelgangers, or that they were the result of extensive interbreeding resulting in an ultimate melting-pot phenotype. However, modern fossil records have shown definitively that humans are simply another offshoot of the early progenitor mammals that are the root ancestors of dwarves, elves, and several other Mainland races.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">In detail, the typical human stands somewhere around 5'9" tall, weighing around 150 pounds at adulthood. Their skin color ranges from bluish-pale to deep ebony, their eye colors can be numerous but typically blacks, browns, and greens, and their hair color will typically be white, brown, black, orange, or occasionally blonde. Humans very rarely possess any color more vibrant or umbral than these naturally, although some are known for favoring dyes or pigments designed to alter hair or skin color to stand out more. This tendency to alter their appearance, however, only exacerbates the common view of humans as being "such race, without something", like "Elves without pointed ears" or "Dwarves without proper beards" or "Hobgoblins without thicker skin", etc.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Society</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">"Human Society" is considered, by most, to be a contradiction in terms; moreso than any other race, humans have a noted tendency towards infighting, schisms, and, ultimately, population dissolution. Indeed, this difficulty to congregate in great numbers without encountering some kind of impasse may actually explain much of humanity's success as a species; driven by a need to escape from unwelcome neighbors, humanity has become one of the most geographically spread intelligent race of any on the Mainland Continent, occupying settlements in nearly every corner of the continent. This continual spread meant that early human settlements experienced little shortage of forage and game, and as such grew in number significantly, which then only encouraged further splitting, etc etc. As such, it comes as little surprise that humans, as confirmed in recent Censuses, are the single most populous of the Common races of the Mainland continent. Further aiding this ability to work in any niche environment is their physiology, which seems perfectly balanced to give them an edge in any area. This is not to say they excel in all environments; rather, just that their generalized body design and mental plasticity make them capable of occupying any niche which is not already claimed by another species specialized to live there.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">However, this divisiveness and lack of coherent social mores has had a rather negative impact on the development of the race as a whole; while humans can claim the largest population, they can claim little else, as other races are more advanced technologically, magically, militarily, logistically, etc etc. However, this is where the human talent for adaptability comes in handy once again, as humans have a noted talent for not just environmental, but also social, adaptation, quickly integrating themselves into existing communities and making themselves useful in any fields and roles which currently need to be fulfilled. As such, while rarely innovators in any field, humans are noted early adopters, and have been known to take any new development, be a new agricultural process or refined cantrip, and run with it with incautious abandon, quickly outpacing the spread of the development among it's original creators. This also means that humans are an invaluable source of field testing, a fact which many organizations are now working to exploit.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Indeed, this capability to latch onto new concepts and retain them has only become more pronounced as communications and educational advances have developed; while humans have always been known for their ability to learn new tricks, there is a growing subset of humans which demonstrate this skill at learning to such an obsessive degree that it can become unnerving, even for other humans. Called "Variants" by other races, due to the wide variety of obsessions they may succumb to, these are humans that are not merely content with knowing surface details about a given technology or magic or hobby, but which become passionately entrenched in the minutia, learning the skill down to the smallest detail. For example, while any guard knows of the importance of keeping their armor cleaned and maintained, a variant will immerse themselves in all aspects of armor lore, spending hours testing new varieties of polish to ensure best performance and appearance, researching new fighting stances to best direct blows to armored regions, endlessly extolling the virtues of one steel alloy over another for each piece, and even finding like-minded individuals to congregate with and form social clubs dedicated to discussing the best way to keep rings mail from clumping up. However, this mania often takes a toll on the Variant's other areas of life, as they eschew opportunities to broaden their skill set in favor of honing their preferred area of expertise. While the vast majority of these individuals make obsessive study of fields of great interest to them, it is also possible for this capacity for knowledge retention to be induced for any discipline, particularly in childhood, when human mental plasticity is at it's peak.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While, as mentioned, humans are spread all over the Mainland continent, there are certain congregations of them which help illuminate the human talent for adaptation.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Circle Sea City States</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">While the vast majority of the most powerful City States were founded by more developed races, the influx of humanity has steadily threatened to make these races into minorities in their own cities. While most are willing to accept this outcome in exchange for the endless supply of cheap labor and stable tax base provided by a steadily growing population, others have become increasingly concerned about their cities being effectively conquered from within. While some use the expedient but heavy handed method of expelling human families when their numbers grow too great, others, such as Kebek, have instead instituted mandatory 'citizenship tests' for any individual who wishes to naturalize. These tests are typically rigged to be racially biased towards the city's founder race, allowing them to retain their cheap workforce without needing to provide them any of the normal perks of citizenship. More and more, however, there is growing evidence of humans who have so completely immersed themselves in the cultural identity of these client races that they become nearly indistinguishable from one of their number, even going so far as to utilize cosmetics and prostheses to blend in physically. At this point, no one is totally aware of how many humans may now be living under the guise of other races, but there are rumors that the practice is spreading to municipalities outside of the Circle Seas.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Patchquilt Kingdoms</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Human dominated castle kingdoms are common within the Patchquilt Kingdoms, but one receives special mention for being the oldest known human culture; the Kingdom of Locke. According to surviving records, this Kingdom was founded nearly two millenia ago in the wake of the fall of the Old Lycan Empire. Founded as a bastion for humanity, it was responsible for cementing the manufactured Common language as the official language of humans, and even grew to consume most of the territory now known as the Patchquilt Kingdoms, forming the Empire of Lock. It was one of a sparse number of nations and institutions to survive the apocalyptic Wizard War, although in significantly reduced size; however, even to this day it persists in the Castle Kingdom of Locke, centered on the city of Colin's Bluff. Although the Kingdom claims to have many, well, claims on nearly all of the lands occupied by other Patchquilt Kingdoms, it's fortunes in recent times have been so sparse as to force it to remain on the defensive. Still, if there is one generally agreed upon root to human culture and civilization, it rests within this ancient kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts55">Eastern Jungles</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Demonstrating the human tendency to spread out taken to it's extremes, it is known that there are numerous human settlements located within the Eastern Jungles, in spite of the constant dangers threatened by disease, monsters, orks, and worse. Although living in such an obviously lethal place is unthinkable to most other intelligent races, humanity has nonetheless endured, and by some reports have even managed to strike some bargains with the less unwaveringly homicidal residents of these rain-drenched lands. Not much more can be said about them that isn't obvious; faced with dangers their whole lives, these are hardy, attentive people, renowned for their survival instincts and arrays of knives.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts53">Adventurers</span></p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color : #000000;  background-color : #000000; border-width : 0px;">
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">Human adventurers are, frankly, a silver a dozen. Given their penchant for wanderlust, obsessive study into specific fields, and general adaptability, the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle seem almost suspiciously tailored to their skillset.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts44">That's pretty much all there is to say.</span></p>
